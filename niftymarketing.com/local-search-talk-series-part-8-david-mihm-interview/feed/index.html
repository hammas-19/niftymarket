					<description><![CDATA[Hey Mike,
It was nice to read about your family reunion local search epiphany, as well as getting to read David&#039;s responses. David is definitely one of my favorite fellows in Local. His energy and super attitude shine through every time he speaks. 

Thanks for continuing this series. Blogging has been light all over the Localsphere, as far as I can see, and it&#039;s nice to have something new to read this week.]]></description>
