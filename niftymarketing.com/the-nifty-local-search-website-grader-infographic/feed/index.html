					<description><![CDATA[Hi Mike, this is fantastic. I&#039;ve been building wordpress websites for small businesses for a while now, but the big issue for them was getting found locally. I think we are only just getting into this here in Australia. This has given me some great ideas for evaluating local search. Many thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Mike, I&#039;m doing some similar graphics for my clients. One of the biggest problems I find is explaining the whole location issue. This is huge because most of my clients are home based carpet cleaners that live out in the burbs. I&#039;ve been taking a screen shot from Google Maps and Photoshopping a red circle to designate the centroid. Seems to be getting the point across.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome job, Mike and crew. This really makes it easy to show people what they are already doing well and what else they need to do. Is a local grader tool in the works?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice job, Mike! That looks something fantastic. Now, when do _WE_ get access to the tool? :)
Seriously, though, it&#039;s excellent. I&#039;d love to hear how much more effective this is as a sales tool for Nifty. I&#039;ve always held to the belief that a client that is more educated is a better client. Making it easy for the client to understand supports my theory.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mike:

I love the idea behind what you&#039;re doing. I do something very similar when I do my SEO analysis for clients but I don&#039;t do it via a graphic. I do it via videos but including some kind of graphic is an interesting idea.  

If you&#039;re open to some constructive feedback, the percentages on the right side of the main graphic are confusing. It says, &quot;58% Needs Done&quot; and &quot;42% Done.&quot; I&#039;m not even sure what that means. Then at the top of the graphic you have, &quot;42% overall.&quot; I think having so many percentages and the labels are confusing. I would scrap the  &quot;58% Needs Done&quot; and &quot;42% Done&quot; stuff on the side of the graphic and just leave the main percentage figure at the top of the graphic.
