					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://niftymarketing.com/google-local-business-ads-displaying-everywhere/#comment-172&quot;&gt;Craig Baerwaldt&lt;/a&gt;.

I am guilty as charged. The first one was very difficult as I had to mess with removing Houston and adding Boise to the map. I wised up on the others though. I was wondering if any would catch the area codes ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Miriam, I think Mike got you. A talented local marketer like Mike probably also knows his way around graphics editing software. If you dig a little deeper into the Boise results you will notice that all of the area codes are for Houston, which is a little suspicious for April 1st.

Nice work Mike, as soon as I validated Miriam&#039;s results I knew this was a little April Fool Fun.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Mike,
I am not able to reproduce the results you&#039;ve seen, here in CA. My guess is that you&#039;ve been lucky enough to run into a test. Looks like further rollouts of local ads must be imminent. Thanks for reporting this.

I just shot you and the other local folks an email inquiring HOW you saw David&#039;s ad? Was it just an &#039;seo IN portland or&#039; search? You weren&#039;t seeing this come up without the &#039;in&#039; were you. I got a little excited there for a minute. Please clarify.]]></description>
