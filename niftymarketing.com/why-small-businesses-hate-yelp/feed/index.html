					<description><![CDATA[I hear some people say they used yelp and it was o.k. It gave them good info on services.Great ,We are not saying that yelpers can’t direct you to some good businesses but they can steer you away from some honest companies simply because those company did not cave in and paid for advertising.I will say that yelp does cost the consumer more money for those services that are highly rated/advertise.My business is primarily repeat/referrals.Now if another business has to pay yelp $1200.00 a month for advertising/reviews where do you think they get their money from? You,the consumer. If yelp was truly the unbiased review site that is portraying itself to be then no one would have to pay for advertising. That’s why they tell companies not to ask real customers to send in reviews,seriously they have a section on “Don’t ask customers for reviews”.If a person sees a company that has a 5 star rating with 100′s of great reviews who did not advertise next to a company who pays big bucks for advertising or for being placed on top of the search list with only 3 stars who do you think the customer will contact?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If Yelp must exist then as a business owner or patron one should be able to respond directly to the person in social media form for everyone to see. Yelp is ridiculous, there is a reason why there are professionals that are paid to review businesses and restaurants.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mr. Green, 
Sadly no one at yelp will notice but moreover they wouldn&#039;t give a s**t if they did. Us business owners need to band together and get this evil practice stopped. Unfortunately, as business owners we are too busy to deal with this crap. The result, those that have nothing better to do will continue to assault our life long work and livelihoods until we become a walmart nation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yep, Yelp is bad for business. I had a consumer that bought a Certificate from Yelp. I performed the service and she wrote a review. 

Yelp with their fantastic review filter then FILTERED the review.

Way to go Yelp you really do $u@k.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nifty Marketing has saved the world as we know it, from the &quot;Bieber-sucking experience of online reviews.

					<description><![CDATA[I like Amazon&#039;s format of showing polar opposite reviews. Often times I see a positive reviewer completely bash a negative one telling them they are too cheap or expecting too much from a $2 iphone charger. This can take away the heat of a business being the bad guy during these exchanges. But it could be people have more fun reviewing products than establishments, is it time for Emily Post to update us on leaving reviews?]]></description>
