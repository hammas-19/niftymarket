					<description><![CDATA[Mike Blumenthal is definitely the professor, but EarlPearl has stood out to me from the first (where was that? SEOmoz? Cre8asite?) as the man on the street with that rich, homegrown experience of becoming a crack SEO for the sake of his own small business. I don&#039;t think there is any more organic way of learning the search engine game than when you&#039;re doing it for yourself, and time and again, EarlPearl has come through with amazing, helpful, thoughtful insights. Absolutely one of my favorite fellows in Local.

Another fun interview, Mike. Bravo!]]></description>
