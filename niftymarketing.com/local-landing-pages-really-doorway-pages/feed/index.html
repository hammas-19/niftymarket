					<description><![CDATA[I have client that is actually a law firm in Wisconsin.  I&#039;ve been trying to convince them to do local landing pages but they are against the idea for business reasons not SEO reasons.  I was hoping this post would help me convince them.

Here&#039;s the problem.  The site you picked doesn&#039;t show up in Google for &quot;lawyers appleton wi&quot;.  The main domain shows up for &quot;lawyers appleton wi social security&quot; but not this specific page.  The site also doesn&#039;t show up for &quot;social security attorney&quot; unless you set the search location to Two Rivers, WI where their actual office is.

So I guess my point is that Google may not penalize you since the site is showing up for certain searches, but it&#039;s also not rewarding you by putting you in the search results for locations you&#039;re not in unless the query is very specific.  I like the idea of adding the &quot;Communities We Serve&quot; section, but what if any is the benefit from an SEO perspective?]]></description>

Totally agree. I do a ton of work in the real estate niche, and the SERPs are littered with sites like Zillow, Realtor.com, Trulia etc, that are extremely thin pages, which fit Google&#039;s definitely to a tee of what a doorway page is. 

Meanwhile, I suspect that G will start to nail the actual realtor&#039;s sites, while leaving all of these &quot;authority&quot; sites alone. Oh the joy of SEO:)]]></description>

John, 

I agree with you. We can never know what will happen until Google pulls the trigger. That said, I believe that well-crafted local landing pages are something Google should reward. Basically you are addressing the needs of your users in different markets, who have different needs and different concerns. 

There will always be crappy landing pages that are just trying to pull in more search volume. But the more I see pages like this: https://www.airbnb.com/locations/los-angeles/pasadena, the more I believe this is future of the internet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Logically this all makes sense, but any of us who have been dealing with Google for years, understand that we won&#039;t know exactly what is going on until the dust has settled.

If they do start targeting geo specific pages and the alike, this update is going to affect a lot of people (I predict 1.2% of all searches lol!). Especially in local markets. I just can&#039;t see them getting that crazy with it, but nothing surprises me with Google anymore.

The data I am seeing, suggest that they have already started rolling the update out in very select niches.

We&#039;ll see. Great post man!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post Lance! I know there&#039;s a lot of confusion and people debating this exact topic, so this post is definitely one that&#039;s getting bookmarked (and used later in heated debate as a trump card). 

Great work, and great clarification]]></description>
