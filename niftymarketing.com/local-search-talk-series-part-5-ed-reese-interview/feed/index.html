					<description><![CDATA[Hey Mike,

Thanks for putting together this local search interview series!  I&#039;ve really enjoyed reading it and am blushing a bit at being asked to participate.  This is going to be one interesting year when it comes to local search.  

And on the frisbee golf front, I just played my first par round (54) on a tournament course this morning and beat my old personal best by four strokes.  I&#039;m not sure how many local search folks are into disc golf, but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if there were some players out there.

Thanks again!]]></description>
