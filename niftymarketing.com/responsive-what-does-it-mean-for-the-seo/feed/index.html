					<description><![CDATA[Nice post Nifty Curtis.  Writing/blogging for the first time is definitely overwhelming.  I&#039;m new to it as well, very humbling.  

Working with Mike and having face time with the other contributors for Local Ranking Factors is an enormous opportunity!  I&#039;ll look forward to more great content in the future.

PS
I&#039;m going to steal, wait borrow &quot;Responsive SEO&quot; from you.  I&#039;ll give it back later.  I promise.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice one Curtis.

Agree with everything but i think that you need to be more radical than just &#039;responsive&#039;. As far as i can see it, on line marketer MUST BE PROGRESSIVE. Meaning, think about the next thing that going to be changed or that will put you in black list.

For instance- addresses issue in GP. It was/ is really easy to forecast it&#039;s evolution &amp; even put time-frames for each change in Maps Guide Lines &amp; enforcement (fake--&gt;PO box--&gt;UPS--&gt; Virtual Office--&gt; ???). If you don&#039;t have a solution for the ??? stage- you are well behind! &amp; trust me, there is a huge amount of solutions for that.

As well for Panda, Caffeine, Site Layout, etc..

Bottom line, in today&#039;s on line marketing world, you have to be 2 steps ahead of Google &amp; 4 steps ahead of your potential clients intents.

And i&#039;ll finalize with 1 of the best movies&#039; Cliches- Turkish: &quot;For every action, there is a reaction. And a Pikey reaction... is quite a f#*king thing.&quot;]]></description>
