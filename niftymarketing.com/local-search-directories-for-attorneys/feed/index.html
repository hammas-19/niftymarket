					<description><![CDATA[Great information. We found our name, address and phone were different on a number of business directories, maps and sites like Nuestar. Correction of those directories made a big difference. Thanks for sharing, passing this along to our clients to illustrate this point.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mike, as a newcomer to the world of SEO, I find this information to be very interesting and informative. We have several clients who in fact are lawyers and I feel that the steps you mention in this post could truly help their online presence. The &quot;don&#039;t spam&quot; point is one that we have been implementing lately, and it really does improve the language and make it more friendly for the people actually looking for information about the lawyer. Thanks for the great information.]]></description>
