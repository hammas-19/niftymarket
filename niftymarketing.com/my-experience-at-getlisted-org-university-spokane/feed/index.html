					<description><![CDATA[Hi Mike:
Did you attend the morning or the afternoon program? We&#039;re thinking about holding a similar program here in the Hawaiian Islands and I&#039;m interested in learning which program attracted the most SMB people. 
Thanks Mike]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great recap Mike.  We are hard at work on Local University landing in the Minneapolis and St. Paul area this spring and I hope to be releasing dates and info soon.  You&#039;ll be one of the first to know and it would be great to get you in town for it as well.

Keep up the great local search work and keep blogging.]]></description>
