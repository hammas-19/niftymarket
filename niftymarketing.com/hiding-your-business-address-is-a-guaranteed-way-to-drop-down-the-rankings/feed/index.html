					<description><![CDATA[Nifty Mike, thanks for the nice case study. Since I own a small business that puts on races at different locations I had decided to not put my full address on, now I think I&#039;ll be changing that decision.  

I know that P.O. Boxes are a no-no, but have you seen Google downgrade the rankings of companies that use real addresses from a UPS mailbox?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@david - I am running tests on everything you have mentioned but don&#039;t know how long it will take to come to conclusions on anything (or if I will). If I come up with anything more I will be sure to let you know. As far as a guest post goes, if you have a subject you are wanting something on let me know. I have a pretty full schedule ahead for this site and I run a hyper local &lt;a href=&quot;http://goburley.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;weekly news journal&lt;/a&gt; so I do have to limit the amount of writing time but I am always up for talking local. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Mike, 

This is some great stuff. We inputting some new clients and just noticed this feature. Have you done any testing on how the size of your radius effects search results? Also, we were wondering whether you are better to use the radius feature or choose town by town to build it out (more keywords) This can be easily done by using a radius keyword feature like that on 5minutesite (link below)

http://www.5minutesite.com/local_keywords.php

Let me know. Thanks for the great work. Also, would love you to do a guest post if you have time.]]></description>
