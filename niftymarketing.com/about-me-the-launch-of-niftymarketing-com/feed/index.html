					<description><![CDATA[Mike-
This is a very interesting idea. What a smart way to open up marketing. Although, I guess that I dont understand what type of business are you helping. For example my husband and I have started doing a new business called Primerica. We hope to open an office in Burley next year. What kinds of things would you beable to make available for us. We would like to find an easier way to contact are employees then email and text. Please let me know.

Thanks
