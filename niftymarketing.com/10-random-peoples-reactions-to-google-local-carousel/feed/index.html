					<description><![CDATA[Awesome article.

What leaves me asking more questions; Happy&#039;s response about not knowing how/why the content was being populated, and Paul&#039;s comment about fine tuning the search, which often leads to a business&#039; independent website and a non-uniform information hunt.

Sarah B Dank&#039;s comment above is also relevant, would be interesting to see the results for more specific search queries. OR, even ask the same group of users to search for the same thing - and have them use different keywords or phrases and see the results.

Just some thoughts -thanks for the read.

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post Mike.  It&#039;ll be interesting to see what happens with carousel in the future in other verticals/niches. 

I wonder if Google plans on doing any color testing for the bg color in the future to improve ctr and ux.  

Cheers,

Blake]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good one Mike! Barbra&#039;s video is so awesome! This post is so objective. What are your personal thoughts on this new display and whether is good for Google or the users or not. Do you expect it to change significantly? Is this the first of more major display changes that we don&#039;t know about yet?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a really creative way to get some qualitative, focused research done. Love it.  It will be interesting to see how long before you have to pay to play in the carousel. How long before all the middle spaces of the carousel are pay to play?

They could give advertisers a higher quality score based on reviews, location, hours, and not just relevance to the keyword searched and click through rate.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mike, I love this.  It’s way outside the box.  Thanks for posting.

I found it interesting that people (except for Venita) didn’t engage with the scroll arrow to the right of the carousel.  Kinda confirms my suspicions: that it’s hard to notice, and that very few people will use it, because (like Barbara) they’re looking to narrow results, not get another 10 results to look at.

Also wasn’t too surprised that people paid pretty much no attention to the “at a glance” snippets and Zagat scores in the carousel.]]></description>
