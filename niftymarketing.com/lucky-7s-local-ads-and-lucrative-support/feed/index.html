Search Engines have to walk a very fine line when it comes to there ads. Its what brings in the money, but if they ruin the user experience with too many ads, then it defeats the purpose and you lose users. Have you noticed that on some searches, the ads that were pushed all the way to the right side of the page are now coming up quite a bit closer to the left side? I also did a search in a market that is testing the local listing ads and the whole page was ether local ads, or adwords. I don&#039;t think that is a great user experience.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Google is changing, I think too many ads will just make people ignore the ads. By placing less ads with more useful information, people wont ignore them, and this will increase clickthroughs. Google&#039;s getting smarter!]]></description>
