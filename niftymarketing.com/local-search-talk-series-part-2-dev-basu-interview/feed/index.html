Mr. Man,

Maybe if you cared about these people and their careers then they would share there thoughts on local with you. ;)

By the way there are some major nuggets of information throughout the series. I&#039;m  just a very big fan of a person digging their own treasure and not being spoon fed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Aaron - There are going to be way more links to come that point people to some great stuff! Truthfully, the links people need to check out from this interview are Dev&#039;s recent article I linked at the top (great guide for starters), his video which I watch before I go to bed each night, and all the talented people he pointed out on twitter. 

@Miriam I won&#039;t be surprised if it goes 10 for 10 on the least favorite things.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm...I wonder how many of us will list dealing with Google&#039;s vagaries as our least favorite thing about local :)

Really a nice interview. I definitely learned new things about Dev! The series is progressing well, Mike.
