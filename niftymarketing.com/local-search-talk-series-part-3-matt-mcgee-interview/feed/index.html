					<description><![CDATA[Funny set of answers, Matt.  Bravo.  Nice job.  Spreading the word about hyperlocal blogging is a worth it mission.  After reading this I went and visited a terrific hyperlocal blog about the area in which I grew up.  For me, its an astounding vital nostalgic trip.  

But darn....its so absolutely vital right now.  Its far more telling than the local newspapers of that place and time when I was there.  So wish it had been around when I was growing up and living there.  Keep up the mission and the good work.]]></description>
