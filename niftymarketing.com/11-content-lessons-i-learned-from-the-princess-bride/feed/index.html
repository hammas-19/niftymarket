					<description><![CDATA[Probably the reason why I haven&#039;t blogged for two weeks now is that I was trying to tame my personality as this post I&#039;m working on requires a certain degree of finesse my sarcastic tone, unfortunately, does not possess. I was in a rut, thinking why I can&#039;t get past the first paragraph. Blogger&#039;s block? I don&#039; think so.

And then I read Lesson #4. It hit me badly. I was not being myself.

Thanks for such a wonderful post. And yes, making Local sexy is damn catchy. I enjoy reading the About Us page of this site.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow! I never thought that one of my favorite movies would end up as a pack of great lessons to use in our everyday job. Wonderfully analysed and written! Keep it up!

Btw, the soundtrack of this movie by Mark Knopfler is something that kills me every time! Masterpiece!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amazing 24 percent conversion rate. Thanks for the motivation to try harder. I now understand what you meant by saying I would try more messaging on the page. That alone has given me inspiration for my next A/B test. Keep it up Mike and team.]]></description>

Lesson 7 is by far my favorite. Letting people think they are in control is one of the hardest things to do aside from finding common ground with your readers. That&#039;s why, when I find someone who can do it right, I spend hours and hours reading their content. 
I&#039;m glad you liked the post, Jeff. Check back soon for the full write up on lesson 1. It&#039;s going to be epic.]]></description>
