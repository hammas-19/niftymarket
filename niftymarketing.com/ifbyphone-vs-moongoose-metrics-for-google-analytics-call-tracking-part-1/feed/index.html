					<description><![CDATA[Mike,

Great article. I am the marketing manager for a lawn and pest control company outside of Philadelphia. Approximately 75% of our leads come via the phone call. Currently I am researching call tracking companies (Mongoose, Call Rail and Ifbyphone). One thing I&#039;m struggling with is finding a company that can actually tell you &quot;search query&quot; that generated the ad and then followed with a phone call. Is there a company that can provide this service? Does Google release that information? Or can these companies only tell you the keyword that generated the call once they click through to the website? 

Thanks!

P.S. I&#039;ve seen you speak and find your strategies very tactical.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We personally have used both Mongoose and Ifbyphone for our call tracking needs.  Both are quality services but we stayed with Ifbyphone for having faster and friendlier support. (sorry Mongoose)

Also good to note that their pricing is slightly less than Mongoose as well for those companies who are bootstrapping and looking to reduce fixed costs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really great post. I&#039;m using Mongoose right now to test out their services for a small Adwords and LinkedIn campaign I am running, and I am not happy with their response time in terms of billing. It&#039;s been 2 months to try to resolve some charges from a previous employee contract and they have not provided me pricing breakdown so I can put together associated costs to run larger campaigns next year. 

I will be looking at competitors next week based on suggestions left by other readers on this post. Thanks again for the comparison. It gives me a great place to start.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We&#039;re the new kids on the block at LogMyCalls.com. We&#039;ve got mongoose metrics functionality at a much lower price and our customer service is the best. We you need more detail than IfByPhone can provide, check us out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article!!  I have been searching and searching to try and understand how to manage my ppc better.  Would love a follow up to this article.  I&#039;m leaning towards ifbyphone right now because I just got off the phone with them and they answered a lot of my questions.  

Anyone have some more experiences to talk about?  I spoke with a company called ReachLocal and they say they do the same thing. Thanks for the info!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe because of the date this was written, but I didn&#039;t see any comments or suggestions for LogMyCalls. They do everything and more that Mongoose, ifbyphone, marchex, and callsource do. Plus, their pricing is better and our customer service rep is amazing. We started with their Free service and quickly upgraded. I track my calls, quality of my customer service, set goals for my people, recieve real-time notifications, integrated with my CRM, and more. It&#039;s amazing. You should do a comparison of LogMyCalls.com to everyone else. That would be cool.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great stuff and very useful. When&#039;s part II? :)

We&#039;re having trouble getting information from Mongoose Metrics, too. Getting the documentation for their API took weeks and they required a teleconference before we could get it. And they&#039;re not very responsive in general. Hello! We&#039;re trying to give you money.

Time to look at Ifbyphone and Marchex.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am shopping for a phone analytics solution...thanks for the article.  However, before settling on a &quot;dynamically generated phone number&quot; solution, I am trying to find a solution that would allow for a consistent phone number, but instead utilize &quot;Customer Reference #&quot; that can be given to the phone representative similarly to how I assume CSNstores.com does it.  

Does anyone know anything about CSNstores.com system...It appears that they always have the same phone number, an instead rely on the reference number?
Obviously this could be a custom solution, but if not I would love to know what they use.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this article.  Earlier this year a friend of mine mentioned ifbyphone to me.  As I&#039;ve been an IVR developer for most of my career, this was very interesting.  I did a search online for reviews on ifbyphone and ran across this article.  After reading the good reviews here, and after listening to my friend&#039;s recommendation after having used it in his business, I decided to check ifbyphone out.  I was very impressed as it truly makes technologies that have traditionally been available only to large corporations, affordable for the small business owner.  I&#039;m so excited about ifbyphone, that I have formed a new company and become an official reseller for ifbyphone.  If you sign up through my link at http://answersoft.net I can save you $5/month compared to signing up with ifbyphone directly.  Also, I am there to extend a helping hand in setting up your system.  If you need more complicated programming, I&#039;m available for that as well.

Thank you Mike for posting this review.  You were part of the inspiration for starting AnswerSoft.]]></description>
