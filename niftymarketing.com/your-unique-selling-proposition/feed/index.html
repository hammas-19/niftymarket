I agree with you about not wanting to take a risk. But I don&#039;t think very small business needs a professional to help them create their USP or their content. 

If it&#039;s something they are passionate about they could write amazing unique content themselves. I firmly believe that anyone can write awesome content if they are passionate about what they are writing. 

Now having the time to do so... that&#039;s a different story.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mike, I would be interested to hear how this study affects the long term conversion rates. At first glance I was kind of shocked with the new design compared to the old (since you usually see sample A type sites).  Anyhow, are you doing anything else significant that might be affecting the traffic?  Or has the traffic stayed the same with this conversion.  I&#039;m interested to see how this goes for you over time. Great work on out of the box thinking too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nifty Lance:

20 hours for one essay? Holy cow. And I freak out when I spend an hour on a blog post - thinking it&#039;s taking me too long. I work with small businesses every day and the biggest challenge is getting them to understand the importance of high quality, UNIQUE content. So many want to play it safe and are so incredibly nervous to do anything outside of the box. And then those that get it, don&#039;t have the budget to hire a professional to take on such a task.
