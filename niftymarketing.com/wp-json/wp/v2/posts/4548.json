Why not use that net to gain more authority for your business and website?  That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.  To help you with one simple task\u2026<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/today\/post\/article\/20140422062241-1135084-five-reasons-lawyers-should-blog\">START BLOGGING<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/blogimage5.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/blogimage5.png\" alt=\"blogimage5\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1109\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Blogging not only benefits the people that read it, but your website as well.  Being able to produce exciting, new content will help you better engage your audience and provoke them to check out your site for more awesome content.  Keeping your blog post to a minimum word count is important.  You don\u2019t want to make it too long where people are going to start to loose interest 2 minutes in and you definitely don\u2019t make it short enough where the reader thinks after, \u201cWhat did I read?? It seemed more like a brief note than a informative article!\u201d  <\/p>\n<p>Make it a point to blog on a regular set schedule.  Posting a blog on the 1st of the month and waiting 2 more months to make another post is not a good schedule to run off.  You want to be remembered, not replaced!  <\/p>\n<p>Building authority and credibility for your website will come natural with more new and interesting blog posts.  An important reminder is the maintenance of your blog.  MAKE SURE YOU\u2019RE UPDATING YOUR BLOG WEEKLY IF NOT A COUPLE TIMES MONTHLY!  Ideally, <a href=\"http:\/\/legalcareers.about.com\/od\/practicetips\/tp\/Start-A-Blog.htm\">posting a blog weekly<\/a> will keep your content fresh and let your audience know you\u2019re staying up to date on the certain area you\u2019re writing about.  Try making 30 minutes to hour available weekly to produce your blog posts.  Setting that time a side will allow you to clearly focus on what you\u2019re <a href=\"http:\/\/wordsinbold.com\/11-kinds-lawyer-blog-posts\/\">wanting to blog on<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/blogimage3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/blogimage3.png\" alt=\"blogimage3\" width=\"550\" height=\"690\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1107\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The last thing you should be worried about when trying to figure out the type of material to include in your blog post is, \u201cAre people going to like this?\u201d  What you should concern yourself with is the freshness and relevancy you\u2019re creating for your audience.<\/p>\n<p>A blog is a great tactic to help position you as a leader in your specific areas of law practice.  You\u2019re ability to become a public expert in your field and also a trusted source will only build that strong bond between you and the reader.<\/p>\n<h2>Be Aware<\/h2>\n<p>DUPLICATE, DUPLICATE, DUPLICATE content is a killer!  Make sure you\u2019re using your OWN thoughts and also make sure you\u2019re not copying and pasting content from your website or other sites.  Make it real and make it new.  Bots crawling your site will discover duplicate content and this could lead to possible penalties like <a href=\"http:\/\/searchenginewatch.com\/article\/2205821\/Algorithm-Updates-Duplicate-Content-A-Recovery\">Panda<\/a>.  And that could take a long while to get out of depending on the severity of the penalty.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/blogimage1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/blogimage1.jpg\" alt=\"blogimage1\" width=\"393\" height=\"297\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1105\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Sharing case results is a touchy area.  There have been instances where I\u2019ve seen lawyers list case results on their site but never say they can get you the type of money you\u2019re wanting or looking for.  This depends on the state you\u2019re working in.  Make sure to check your state\u2019s statutes and see if there are any guidelines to referencing case results.  There are rules that prevent law firms from guaranteeing prospective clients a certain amount of money.  An example of this would be a lawyer saying, \u201cWe promise our clients millions of dollars\u201d or \u201cWe can get our clients (x) amount of dollars in these types of cases.\u201d  This gives a false impression that you will provide or you are going to get that customer a set amount of money.  If every law firm was able to say this, prospective clients are automatically going to assume they\u2019re going to get top dollar for their case.  Each case is different in it\u2019s own right.<\/p>\n<p>Another great benefit with blogs is the ability to source your information to many social networks. <\/p>\n<h2>Social Status<\/h2>\n<p>Having <a href=\"http:\/\/groovedigitalmarketing.com\/benefits-of-starting-a-blog\/\">fresh new content<\/a> for sites like Google, Bing and Yahoo to crawl is also invaluable.  Having them crawl that new content will not only help your site rank better and give your website the ability to rank better organically, it builds that trust you want to establish between you and the reader(s). <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/blogimage2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/blogimage2.jpg\" alt=\"blogimage2\" width=\"400\" height=\"425\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1106\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Take this fact into consideration.  There are more than 320 million people currently living in the United States.  Of those 320 million+, almost 70% of them have a Facebook page.  70% is an outrageous number!!!  Having the ability to post your blogs on sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+ only increase the importance of having a blog.   Not only that, but the more you add blogs to your social media sites, the more people will like said media profile and will most likely visit your site or refer a friend or colleague to see if the awesome content they just got done reading is also available on your website. <\/p>\n<p>Being able to submit your blog posts to these free social media sites is a way to get great content to your audiences.  More importantly, those targeted audiences that really value what you have to write about or people who are specifically looking for what you\u2019re writing about are going to appreciate it a lot more.  Taking time out to really explain an item or topic builds trust (there I go using the word, trust), but trust really is a big KEY in the success your blogs will have.  Having that extra visibility will only up the amount of visitors to your site and could bring solid inbound links to your site.  Doesn\u2019t this free advertising sound like a viable option now?<\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t Be Scared<\/h2>\n<p>Make sure your content is engaging, update to date, and most importantly ORIGINAL!  One last quote I want to leave you with by Hugh MacLeod.  He said:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBlogging requires passion and authority which leaves most people out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Remember, you\u2019re not only trying to bring more visitors to your site, but also building that trust with your readers.  Show attentiveness, show knowledge, and show trustworthiness.<\/p>\n<p>Now sit down and start making magic\u2026and money!!!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The ability to express yourself through words has been around since well, your grandpa had a grandpa and that grandpa had a grandpa and his grandpa was praying to the thunder God Zeus!
