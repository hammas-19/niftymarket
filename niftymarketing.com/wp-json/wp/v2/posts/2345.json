Deep in the books of Google Lore &#8211; employees are being paid to make Google Plus successful by being hyper active in certain markets that Google has offices in. Their year end bonus is tied to Google+ performance! AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!<\/p>\n<p>OK. Seriously though. It was an interesting find here at Nifty.\u00a0 The data I managed to scrounge up is even more interesting. I\u2019d like to unravel a few things that may be helpful to our local search community and internet marketers in general. Beginning with the end in mind \u2013 here\u2019s why I wanted to share this with everyone: Google+ and G+ local are growing in importance and as such we should know who has influence on the platform to make it successful or make it suck.<\/p>\n<p>First off &#8211; let me explain how I stumbled upon this blog post idea:<\/p>\n<p>One day, as the Niftys and I were having a pow-wow in our old office space (rest in peace) we were exploring some new ideas on how to do local outreach. We were considering different ways to find authorities in local markets and it just so happened we were exploring the San Francisco G+ Local scene. An odd thing kept popping up as we were looking for \u201cTop Reviewers\u201d in the market to connect with. We kept finding Google employee after Google employee that was considered a \u201cTop Reviewer\u201d.\u00a0 Well this happened over and over and over again. Really, we thought it was an anomaly. Eventually, chirping crickets followed our amazement and we knew we were sitting on a GOLD mine of conspiracy and outright scandal.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/Screen-Shot-2013-03-20-at-11.39.25-AM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2347\" title=\"Andy_fascinating\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/Screen-Shot-2013-03-20-at-11.39.25-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"870\" height=\"422\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Andy, I <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">totally<\/span> agree.<\/p>\n<p>I told myself that if I\u2019m alive, after completing this research, come February\/March \u2013 I&#8217;m going to write an expos\u00e9 and unravel the <strong>Google Plus Top Reviewers Conspiracy<\/strong>. After several assassination attempts here I am and it\u2019s going down!<\/p>\n<p>It should be noted that I selected the cities that Google has operated in for the longest period of time, hoping these cities would have the highest concentration of Google employees.\u00a0 If I found someone that had a \u201ctechie\u201d job title but no company I\u2019d do some ninja scrubbing by checking LinkedIn and finding their employment information.\u00a0 Creepy? Maybe. I was able to uncover several undercover employees this way\u2026I am learned in G+ stalking \u2013 that\u2019s for sure.

Will the data support that assumption? Or will I be humbled? Dun dun DUNNNNNNNNN!!!!<\/p>\n<h2>Here\u2019s the scope of the research:<\/h2>\n<p>Cities examined:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>San Francisco<\/li>\n<li>Pittsburgh<\/li>\n<li>Seattle<\/li>\n<li>New York City<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I did basic research on 3 different levels of G+:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Google+ Local Places Aggregate Level<\/li>\n<li>Google+ Local Business Page Level \u2013 Reviews 1-6<\/li>\n<li>Google+ Local Business Page Level \u2013 Review 7-16<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I\u2019ve outlined each of the above levels with a series of questions that I wanted to find out before researching.

Of those 8 \u2013 they dominated all but 10 spots in the Top 50 default businesses I reviewed. I\u2019ll delve into this data more below. Furthermore, each city has at least 1-2 dominant reviewers but they aren&#8217;t always Google Employees! Awe shucks. That\u2019s really the least interesting thing though as this study really looks at things as they correlate in the aggregate.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Key Take Aways \u2013 Crunchin\u2019 Numbers So You Don\u2019t Have To<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/Screen-Shot-2013-03-20-at-12.14.24-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2363\" title=\"Screen Shot 2013-03-20 at 12.14.24 PM\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/Screen-Shot-2013-03-20-at-12.14.24-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"259\" height=\"162\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Think about it \u2013 there are ~38,585 people in San Francisco using G+ (thanks findpeopleonplus.com) and 80% of the \u201cTop Reviewers\u201d are Google employees! Even if you average these numbers out (39%) it\u2019s still a staggering number.<\/p>\n<p>I wanted to just show the PlusClout score and compare myself to a G+ Top Reviewer and an A-list celebrity: Britney Spears (leave her alone!), and Brian Downing, a decorated Top Reviewer on G+ in San Francisco and Google employee. If only you could get a review from\u00a0Britney\u00a0Spears (good luck, I searched her profile and her peeps don\u2019t leave \u2018em). However, let&#8217;s say you network with Top Reviewers: you can imagine how powerful it\u2019d be to have Brian (or any Top Reviewer) going to bat for your business \u2013 memorize his face\u2026and make sure he get\u2019s his coffee the way he wants it! Your business may rest in his hands.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/Screen-Shot-2013-03-20-at-12.24.04-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2364\" title=\"Screen Shot 2013-03-20 at 12.24.04 PM\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/Screen-Shot-2013-03-20-at-12.24.04-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"859\" height=\"363\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Another interesting post would be researching these businesses and seeing how they rank and if these Top Reviewers have any influence or indication of increasing ranking which is outside the scope of this post. But here is one thing that IS super useful in analyzing Top Reviewers for link outreach opportunities in specific niches. Let\u2019s take a stroll down Brian Downing\u2019s G+ profile and see what we can glean\u2026<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">1. Go to the About page<\/h4>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">When researching a G+ member for outreach opportunities it\u2019s important to learn about them as much as humanly possible. You want to connect, see what\u2019s interesting to them, and overall take note on what they have their hands in. You\u2019ll learn amazing things! Here\u2019s a little snapshot of Brian Downing&#8217;s G+ About page.

Approximately 5% of the Top 6 Reviewers in a Places page are Google employees in the markets I looked at. Obviously, there is a margin of error but there is no way I\u2019m going to attempt to calculate it. <a href=\"https:\/\/theyellowumbrellaboutique.com\/collections\/baby-car-seat-covers\">Baby Car Seat Covers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>3.
