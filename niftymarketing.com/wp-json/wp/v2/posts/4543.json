I\u2019ve talked to more than one attorney in this situation and they want to choke a puppy.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-950 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/image04.jpg\" alt=\"surprised seo dog\" width=\"75%\" height=\"75%\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now look, I understand that some reading this deserve what they get, while others are just innocent. I come bearing good news&#8230;my advice will help both parties and everyone in between. Here\u2019s a quick background on penalties in case this is news to you. I\u2019m not going to dive super deep but this will at least build a little context:<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Panda Penalty<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There was a time that a website could have duplicate, low quality, thin, and otherwise crappy website content and still rank like a boss. Panda aimed to change that and has done a pretty good job. Over time, Google has stopped frequent major updates and is now rolling these algorithm updates into their major 200+ factor algorithm. Typically, these updates are happening every 1-2 weeks.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/image22.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-968 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/image22.png\" alt=\"image22\" width=\"75%\" height=\"75%\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Penguin Penalty<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>This targets over-optimized anchor text, unnatural and otherwise spammy links that point to your website. You\u2019re also a target if you have a ton of links pointing to your home page and proportionately very few to your subpages. So let\u2019s say your company has gone gangbusters building links to your site with the anchor text \u201clos angeles personal injury attorney\u201d &#8211; you are in trouble. Penguin has, in essence, become more and more strict on the percentage of exact match anchor text your site can have and we estimate 3-6% is the threshold. Like Panda, this is also an algorithmic update and generally believed not to be tied into Google\u2019s mega-algorithm. Typically, updates to this algorithm can range in severity (sitewide &amp; partial) and occur every 6-9 months Google rolls out a new and improved update. So if you\u2019re hit by Penguin, you literally have to wait until the next update. To put it in perspective: the last update was October 2013. Ouch.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Manual Action<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>This is perhaps the easiest to diagnose of the penalties because it is the ONLY penalty where Google actually tells you with a personal message. How kind. Google\u2019s Webspam team will personally review the links pointing to your site and make a determination if your site is following their guidelines. If not, you get slapped hard. The recovery process is long. Sometimes longer than Penguin but <b><i>definitely<\/i><\/b> more difficult to get lifted by design. They want to you repent, take more than your share of lashings and promise to never be a link spammer again.

Ignored it, but thought \u201cHow bad could it really be?\u201d 1-2 years later, you\u2019re getting NOTHING. The first thing Nifty does is check for major penalty signals. Here\u2019s two sicknesses that are epidemics in the Law SEO space, and\/or signs you\u2019re getting bent over a barrell:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>1. \u00a0Squeaky-Wheel-itus:<\/strong> \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can\u201d = Translation = We\u2019re trying to figure out how to get you some quick results (spamming your site some more) so you\u2019ll leave us alone.

Drops in traffic to your site with little to no recovery.<\/h3>\n<p>There are a lot of reasons that traffic can change dramatically and my purpose isn\u2019t to name all of them. There can also be some \u201cphantom drops\u201d in traffic as well, this is typically when you have a cyclical practice area. But as it relates to penalties, a basic dive in traffic of 15%+ is something to raise an eyebrow over. \u00a0Especially if the drop correlates with an algorithm update. If you\u2019re interested in how to keep up to speed with how the latest in algorithm changes I\u2019d recommend\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/moz.com\/google-algorithm-change\">http:\/\/moz.com\/google-algorithm-change<\/a> and\/or following <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Marie_Haynes\">Marie Haynes<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rustybrick\">Barry Schwartz<\/a> on Twitter.<\/p>\n<h3>3. \u201cWe\u2019re hard at work figuring this out.\u201d<\/h3>\n<p>OK if your company isn\u2019t being straight up with you, you\u2019ll hear something like this come out of your account manager&#8217;s mouth. From attorneys I\u2019ve spoken with, \u00bd of them don\u2019t even know they are under penalty, and the other \u00bd have gotten a line like this, and upon further inspection, their company has been trying to \u201cfigure this out\u201d for quite some time.

Google has two different types of actions they take: Sitewide, and Partial. Both can be tricky, but sitewide is definitely bad news, and longer term. Here\u2019s why: Let\u2019s say you have been practicing for over 15 years and you\u2019ve always had a website and you may even consider yourself a \u201cseasoned SEO veteran\u201d. This also means that as your site has grown, tactics that were once considered admissible are now prohibited, and violate Google\u2019s guidelines. You may have thousands or even tens of thousands of links to your site. The more links you have the more difficult the road ahead of you. Google is hardly helpful in telling you exactly what is wrong with the links to your site; some would even say they are vague. BUT, this is where you and your team will have to do some serious scrubbing to reach out to website owners 1-by-1 and tell them to \u201cpretty please with a cherry on top remove the link on your site\u201d. Some will. Some won\u2019t. Remember when I told you they want you to NEVER violate their guidelines again, take your lashings, repent, etc? Well, let\u2019s say you have thousands of links? This process takes a while and you have to be detailed because once you\u2019re done you need to write a lengthy explanation telling what you\u2019ve done and how you\u2019re changing your ways.

So over time, you will do the work and depending on how aggressive the work is it may take several passes. Even once your once-penalized site has this action removed, you can assume you won\u2019t see a huge leap back into the top rankings.

Consider this a starting point for a conversation about warranting a further look into the situation.<\/li>\n<li>Sometimes this tool is buggy, so walk through this process a few times to ensure you\u2019re seeing things correctly<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s say all the warning signs are there and you see an obvious hit (a major blow to your traffic with no recovery) and you see some concerns when you compare your traffic using Panguin. First off, a lot of what I\u2019ve laid out in the \u201cManual Penalty\u201d section applies here. \u00a0You still have to do some serious hacking to your website\u2019s link profile to remove questionable and otherwise spammy links. Some experts believe that no more than 3-5% of your total links can be exact match. Problem is, you still have the limitations on downloading all the links you need to clean things up (on purpose). Perhaps the worst part of a Penguin penalty: there is NO resubmission process once you\u2019ve completed this work. So essentially you have 1 shot at this. If you are not aggressive, you\u2019ll probably still remain under penalty. You still have to wait until the next update. For the record, this update happens historically every 6-9 months. To date, as of today we\u2019ve entered Month 10. So the internet universe of spamming minions are awaiting the date when the latest version of Penguin is released. That said: no one knows when the next rollout happens. Hence the echos of frustration from thousands of website owners. Again, using Panguin is a place to start exploring the possibility of a penalty but it does not absolutely mean you have a penalty. Some experts have discussed what they believe it will take to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.quicksprout.com\/2014\/05\/14\/how-to-avoid-getting-slaughtered-by-penguin-3-0\/\">avoid getting nailed by future Penguin penalties.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Moving Forward After a Penguin Penalty:<\/h3>\n<p>I don\u2019t recommend anyone go out and try to fix this themselves. It can be hard to know what to look for when creating a disavow file (this is a spreadsheet you submit to Google that tells them to ignore specific links or domains). Get in touch with someone you trust; someone who will shoot straight. Keep in mind, you need to invest some money into investigating this further, even if it is proactive, so you can steer clear of future penalty issues. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Don\u2019t forget the \u201cInternet Principles of the Universe\u201d<\/strong><\/span> &#8211; you will get what you pay for with penalty work.<\/p>\n<h3>Expectations from here on out:<\/h3>\n<p>Expect to wait it out, especially if you have tens of thousands of links (or hundreds of thousands for that matter). You can expect most companies to attack this at the domain level (sometimes 1 domain will account for a very very large number of links to your website.) If that is the case, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that website needs to be added to the disavow list. Let your SEO company or whomever is doing the penalty\/recovery work recommend that. Perhaps the most important thing is this: If you are in danger (let\u2019s say you don\u2019t have a penalty but you have a spammy link profile) be proactive, but expect a slip in rankings. \u201cWhy in the hee-haw would I do that?\u201d Pay today or pay tomorrow &#8211; but eventually spam will catch up to you. Hopefully you can avoid a full-on penalty by taking out some insurance today and disavowing some links today that may hurt you tomorrow. \u00a0A slip in rankings is nothing compared to being in link purgatory for up to 10 months. So, whether you have a need to prevent or fix a penalty, here\u2019s a simple way to see what types of links are pointing to your site from Google\u2019s perspective.<\/p>\n<h1>How Many Links Are Pointing to My Site?<\/h1>\n<p>1.

You now have your list to begin scrutinizing for the disavow file. The goal here is to visit each domain on the list and determine whether it is a good, reputable, or relevant site to link with. That\u2019s the gist, but by no means is it that easy. For example, initially this update targeted unnatural links pointing to the homepage whereas the latest installment (October 2013) targeted websites that have heavy links to the homepage and very few to sub pages.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a picture from one of our favorite tools, CognitiveSEO.com. They have a graphical way of showing how many links point to home pages and subpages&#8230;check it out: Probably one of the best link profiles I\u2019ve ever seen &#8211; great linking depth into all sub pages.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/image07.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-953 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/image07.png\" alt=\"image07\" width=\"75%\" height=\"75%\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Very heavy links to the homepage, very few to subpages &#8211; this site has a target on their backs.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/image12.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-958\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/image12.png\" alt=\"image12\" width=\"75%\" height=\"75%\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>At any rate, this can become very involved with a lot of moving parts, so I recommend leaving this to the pros.<\/p>\n<h4>Competitor Spy Tool:<\/h4>\n<p>This is an awesome resource if you\u2019re wanting to do some recon and\/or too lazy to follow my blog. I\u2019ve found it to be really accurate:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/feinternational.com\/website-penalty-indicator\">http:\/\/feinternational.com\/website-penalty-indicator<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Another way to understand the history of your website would be to check your Webmaster Tools message from times past. A company would have to submit the disavow or reconsideration request through your WMT\u00a0account.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to check it out if you aren&#8217;t sure if recovery efforts have been made in the past or present:<\/p>\n<p>1. Log in to Webmaster Tools<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2. Click &#8220;Site Messages&#8221; on the left<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3. Now you can see what types of activities have been going on and what has been communicated to Google<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/png-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-970\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/png-1.png\" alt=\"png-1\" width=\"75%\" height=\"75%\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1>Panda (Content) Penalty Diagnosis:<\/h1>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Timeline for removal: 1 week to several months<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Difficulty to detect: Easy &#8211; Moderate<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Difficulty to get removed: Relatively hard.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">What you need: login information for Google Webmaster Tools (WMT) and Google Analytics.<\/p>\n<h3>Here\u2019s what you do to self diagnose, step-by-step:<\/h3>\n<h4>Step 1. Use the same Panguin Steps 1-7 that you did for Penguin<\/h4>\n<p>The only difference is now you\u2019re focusing on comparing your traffic drops to Panda updates (red lines). \u00a0As I mentioned before, this filter targets thin, low quality, and\/or duplicate content. However, unlike Penguin, Panda is now tied into the major algorithm which from a recovery outlook is really good for some, and terrible for others. Let me explain:<\/p>\n<h4>Step 2. Use these tools to scan for red flags in your content internally and externally<\/h4>\n<p>*Keep in mind, I\u2019m walking you through how to use these tools. Overall, I chose not to show you duplicate content issues because I\u2019d really like to not put people on blast or out anyone on accident.<\/p>\n<h2>Epic duplicate content tool #1: Plagium.com<\/h2>\n<p>Simply copy a block of text and paste it into the box.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/png.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-969\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/png.png\" alt=\"png\" width=\"75%\" height=\"75%\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Plagium shows you where there are occurrences of that same text throughout the web. There is a paid and more thorough version to this tool, but I&#8217;ve found the quick search does an adequate job, all things considered.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-963\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/image17.png\" alt=\"image17\" width=\"75%\" height=\"75%\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This tool is extremely effective in identifying duplicate content for specific blocks of text whether it be on your homepage or subpages.<\/p>\n<h2>Epic duplicate content tool #2: Copyscape<\/h2>\n<p>The beauty of Copyscape.com is that it checks for duplicate content at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.homepage.com\">www.homepage.com<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hompage.com\/sub-page\">www.hompage.com\/sub-page<\/a> levels. Obviously, there is a beefed up paid version, but for our purposes you will be able to see if your money pages are being copied by a competitor or vice versa. \u00a0It\u2019s rather simple to use:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/image15.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-961\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/image15.png\" alt=\"image15\" width=\"75%\" height=\"75%\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a quick screenshot of how Copyscape highlights duplicate content:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-956\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/image10.png\" alt=\"image10\" width=\"75%\" height=\"75%\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Pretty slick right? So whether you pulled a fast one and copied another attorney website word for word years ago or spun a competitors content, Panda has proven to be pretty efficient with identifying any funny business. The main takeaway here is that depending on how long you\u2019ve been at it, you may have thousands of pages that need correcting, or you may just have a few.<\/p>\n<h3>Moving Forward With A Panda Penalty:<\/h3>\n<p>Depending on the size of your website it may be cost-prohibitive to pursue recourse from a deep Panda hit. The resources it\u2019d take to rewrite hundreds of pages may outweigh the benefit gained. This is where a skilled set of eyes is really helpful. Our basic process in helping an attorney is to audit all of their major pages (not including blogs, unless they get flagged in the duplicate content process). The rule of thumb here is to prioritize what\u00a0pages to analyze by whether the page is getting traffic or not. So if I were your content doctor I\u2019d prescribe a full content strategy followed by a content audit. The content strategy will help you know whether the content on your site follows the appropriate voice, tone, and messaging. It should also outline how to speak to your intended audience in an effective but natural way. A well thought out content strategy will speed up a content audit dramatically by allowing you to easily decide what content falls into the following three categories:<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">1. Need rewritten completely: scrap the page and make it sing.<\/h4>\n<h4 style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">2. It needs to go: basically, the page is so bad or irrelevant that it can be deleted.<\/h4>\n<h4 style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">3. Needs reworking: overall, the page is salvageable but needs some help<\/h4>\n<p>Your audit deliverable should tell you exactly what needs to be done in order to get you out of a Panda penalty.<\/p>\n<h3>Expectations from here on out:<\/h3>\n<p>Once your website content is reworked your site will naturally bounce back and you\u2019ll see some recovery. The hardest part here is the upfront cost to figure out what it will take to pass the Panda filter. However, once the content work is complete your site will naturally regain some rankings within 6-8 weeks (sometimes sooner). Don\u2019t forget, Panda is tied to Google\u2019s main algorithm and updates occur quite often.<\/p>\n<h1>Sum it up!<\/h1>\n<p>Hopefully this post gave you some basic knowledge into how penalties work, what you can do to diagnose some of the basics, and what to do if you find yourself in trouble. Remember that no matter if you find yourself on Google\u2019s good side today, the next update may rock your world. So be proactive, spend some time and money cleaning up what you have &#8211; or you may be paying for it (literally and figuratively) later.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There is only one thing worse than SEO that gets you nothing in terms of results, and that is an SEO package that gets you straight up penalized.
