In the coming months I will be taking a closer look at each section of our study in a multi-part blog series.<\/p>\n<p>Part one of this series will be dedicated to our take-aways around \u201cCitations\u201d and citation <em>consistency<\/em>. Welcome to part one! I\u2019m excited to share our findings with you.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>A Quick Look at Citations:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>What the heck is a \u201ccitation\u201d?\u00a0 These words are often what I hear from the attorneys I work with, so let me start there. A \u201ccitation\u201d in the simplest form, is any mention of your NAP (<strong>N<\/strong>ame, <strong>A<\/strong>ddress, <strong>P<\/strong>hone) across the internet with or without a link back to your website.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Citation_PoliceOfficer.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-788\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Citation_PoliceOfficer.jpg\" alt=\"Citation_PoliceOfficer\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Meat &amp; Potatoes of Our Study: <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>We looked at a slew of information for each law firm, including reviews, citations, NAP consistency, Google+ profiles and an analysis of their link profiles.<\/p>\n<p>We focused on both the local listings, the organic listings, the top 3 positions on page one and the bottom 3 positions on page one and what we found was very interesting.<\/p>\n<p>Of the 1200+ websites we studied, those that ranked in the top 3 spots on page one had an average of 44 citations. Of those that ranked in the bottom 3 spots of page one had an average of 37 citations.\u00a0 Only 12% had local specific citations and 21% had niche specific. We saw an incredibly low number of law firms with low quantity and quality of citations. While there are many items that contribute to local rank and website value, these findings show there is an enormous opportunity for attorneys to jump ahead of the pack in this specific area.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Quotes from the NiftyLaw SEO Nerdery:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>I spoke with several Nifty team members, including our \u201ccaptain\u201d, Mike Ramsey and here\u2019s what a couple of them had to say.<\/p>\n<p>Mike Ramsey, Owner\/CEO (not sure of his title) \u201c<em>I thought it was interesting that consistency trumped quantity. We talk often about how important it is to have you NAP information correct but it seems the industry has been spending more time on finding ways to scale the building of new citations and needs to focus more on cleaning up what is already there<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Dax Greener, Nifty Law\u2019s Director of Operations stated, \u201c<em>The biggest takeaway for me in regards to citations was consistency over quantity. Some firms that had a lot more citations than others weren&#8217;t ranking as well because of inconsistencies. This reiterated the importance of being as clean as possible when it comes to a firms\u2019 local listings. \u00a0This should be a priority for any firm.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I also spoke with Chad Henkel, Nifty Law\u2019s Director of Marketing and he stated, \u201c<em>The most interesting takeaway with citations for me is how much opportunity law offices have to create distance between themselves and competitors. Many firms had incomplete, duplicate, and unclaimed listings that another firm with a legitimate local strategy could come in and really shake things up. Even in large metro markets.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A special thanks to Mike, Dax and Chad for sharing their thoughts with me about their findings.\u00a0 Do you see the common denominator? Consistency, Consistency, Consistency!\u00a0 Instead of focusing on quantity \u2013 consistency is playing a bigger role than ever! \u00a0Quantity is the total number of citations you have and while it\u2019s important to have a large number of citations, it\u2019s even more important that the listings you do have match and are consistent across the web.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What is \u201cConsistency\u201d and what does it mean in relation to Citations?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Let me show you three samples of three different listings for one company:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Listing #1:<br \/>\nABC Co.<br \/>\n123 My Road, #117<br \/>\nSalt Lake City, Utah<br \/>\n(801) 567-5678<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: red\"><strong>Listing #2:<\/strong><br \/>\nAlfa Beta Cappa Company<br \/>\n123 My Rd Ste 117<br \/>\nSLC, Utah<br \/>\n(801) 334-3456<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: blue\"><strong>Listing #3:<\/strong><br \/>\nAlfa Beta Cappa<br \/>\n#117 123 My Road<br \/>\nSalt Lake City, UT<br \/>\n(800) 123-1234<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Note how different each of the listings are \u2013 can YOU tell that they are the same business?\u00a0 Then try to imagine how the search engines see these listings?<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/ABC_blurred.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-794\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/ABC_blurred-300x187.png\" alt=\"ABC_blurred\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nCan you read this?\u00a0 I didn\u2019t think so.\u00a0 But THIS is how Google and other search engines are seeing your listings if they have inconsistencies.\u00a0 Did you just let out a huge \u201cSigh\u201d?\u00a0 Great, then we are on the same page with the importance of consistent citations.\u00a0 So now you are probably asking yourself \u201cwhere do I go from here\u201d . . . keep reading my friend.<\/p>\n<p>(Special thanks to Mike Ramsey for letting me borrow his analogy from his Lawyernomics presentation!)<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Next Steps: Citation Work in a Nutshell: <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, building good quality, consistent citations takes time and cleaning up old citations with outdated information takes even more. It\u2019s tedious and tiring work but the law firm that focuses its efforts here will be one step (or many) ahead of their competition.\u00a0 Sounds easy, huh? It\u2019s not.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How To Get Started:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The best way to get started is to start a spreadsheet. Then go to www.Moz.com\/local.\u00a0 Once there go to \u201cCheck My Listing Score\u201d enter your Business name and zip and click on \u201cCheck My Listing\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>These results will show you the current condition of your citation health, which top tier citations are complete, incomplete, percentage of inconsistencies and which have duplicate listings.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Moz-Local-image.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-795\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Moz-Local-image-300x142.png\" alt=\"Moz Local image\" width=\"300\" height=\"142\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Next, you will want to cross-compare those results with the results from www.Yext.com. This will show you specific items that need to be addressed such as wrong phone numbers, addresses or differing business names, etc.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Yext-PowerListings-_Snapshot.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-796\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Yext-PowerListings-_Snapshot-300x209.png\" alt=\"Yext PowerListings _Snapshot\" width=\"300\" height=\"209\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Both of these tools are free but also offer paid versions. I recommend starting here to see where you are at. Using these two free tools will help you to 1) configure your spreadsheet, 2) keep your login credentials straight and 3) track what needs attention.<\/p>\n<p>Our biggest take away is that <strong><em>consistency <\/em><\/strong>is playing a much bigger factor in 2014 than in 2008.\u00a0 Remember when simply claiming your business on Google would get you in the top three spots on page one? \u00a0In 2014, consistency is going to continue to play an increased role in the trust and value of your site in the search engine\u2019s eyes. You must have quantity AND consistency!<\/p>\n<p>If you getting nothing else from this blog post, remember this point: Number of citations is not nearly as important as the quality of each citation. The less is more rule definitely applies here and will continue to grow more important in 2014 and beyond.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The SEO team at NiftyLaw.com participated in a two month long study of legal websites.\u00a0 We looked at over 1200 legal websites across 100 top cities.
