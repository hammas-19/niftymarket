This man brings a very unique perspective to local search, and has some of the best insights that you will read\u00a0 (if you are lucky enough to catch up with him on some of the top local search blogs). So, as my good friend Nacho always says..&#8221;Let&#8217;s get down to the nitty gritty.&#8221;<!--more--><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you initially get involved with internet marketing and what were you wearing at the time?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mike:\u00a0 I like the last part of the question best.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u00a0might have\u00a0included one of those ultra plush robes\u00a0borrowed for all time (stolen)\u00a0from a luxury hotel.\u00a0 (Mike Blumenthal should have seen me in all my robed glory.)\u00a0 \ud83d\ude09\u00a0 Haha!\u00a0 Probably wearing sneakers.\u00a0 Definitely wasn&#8217;t naked!!!<\/p>\n<p>I think I got started around 2003.\u00a0 We owned\/operated businesses at the time.\u00a0 They had websites with contact forms developed by programmers\/designers years earlier.\u00a0 I started to notice two things that seemed very important and read a third thing that also seemed critical.<\/p>\n<p>1.\u00a0 We were getting more automated contact form responses, and callers were saying they found us on the web (which was all new).\u00a0 It was a large increase.<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0 \u00a0We primarily\u00a0weren&#8217;t ranked highly in search engines.\u00a0 Competitors were.\u00a0 That got us nervous.<\/p>\n<p>3.\u00a0 I think the\u00a0article I read\u00a0was in\u00a0the WSJ.\u00a0 It referenced the importance of Google and how links were critical to high rankings.\u00a0 We contacted our &#8220;webmaster&#8221; to discuss this.\u00a0 He told us he could get high\u00a0Search Engine\u00a0rankings for us.\u00a0 When we met he emphasized something totally different from the article.\u00a0 We gave him the article.\u00a0 He still emphasized other things.\u00a0 We got nervous.<\/p>\n<p>4.\u00a0 I looked around for people who could help us, specifically with regard to this &#8220;magic&#8221; that related to google and possibly the other search engines.\u00a0 I couldn&#8217;t find anybody locally.\u00a0 At that time I scarcely accessed the internet and didn&#8217;t know anything about it.<\/p>\n<p>5.\u00a0 I started reading everywhere I could to learn about search engine rankings, google, and links.\u00a0 I finally came to some SEO forums.\u00a0 That is where I started learning about SEO.\u00a0 I was learning SEO before local SEO.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What made you loco for local?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All our businesses are local Mike.\u00a0 When I started I didn&#8217;t know about keywords, keyword phrases, the difference between generic industry phrases and ones with local modifiers, etc.\u00a0 I was clueless.\u00a0 But all the businesses are local\/regional.\u00a0 Necessity is a great teacher.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have someone  who has helped you along the way in learning local?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the  beginning I learned basic SEO in SEO forums.\u00a0 I really didn&#8217;t know  anything.\u00a0\u00a0 I gained a lot of valuable insights from very experienced  SEO&#8217;s that would carry forward into Local.\u00a0 Actually I&#8217;d say that around  2003, 2004,\u00a02005, 2006, 2007 there were very few people discussing  local search.\u00a0 I was one of the few commentators.\u00a0 In early 2005,  Google.com\u00a0changed its algo in a manner that reflected a\u00a0huge change  with regard to how local businesses were or were not showing for search  terms with a local geo modifier\u00a0 such as St Louis electrician.\u00a0 At that  time most local\u00a0business web sites\u00a0weren&#8217;t showing in the top\u00a010 for  searches like that.\u00a0 After the algo change, lots of businesses started  showing.\u00a0 It was an enormous improvement for Local and there was no  commentary about it.<\/p>\n<p>Two things about that change:\u00a0 Bill  Slawski wrote about the patent that affected the change here:\u00a0 <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cre8asiteforums.com\/forums\/index.php?showtopic=26893&amp;hl=\">http:\/\/www.cre8asiteforums.com\/forums\/index.php?showtopic=26893&amp;hl=<\/a><\/span><\/span> and \ud83d\ude09\u00a0 despite a crummy\u00a0organic algo that kept local businesses from  showing\u00a0in the top ten for\u00a0the most logical searches&#8230;;) my businesses  and sites were strong enough to\u00a0overcome the algo.\u00a0 I have to thank the  SEO experts from those earlier years that helped achieve that.<\/p>\n<p>Once Google inserted Google Maps into organic results\u00a0via Universal  Search everything has changed and in my view, you need expertise in G  Maps, organic and PPC to do a great and thorough job.<\/p>\n<p>As I gravitated toward local I found others who were very helpful.\u00a0 Once Maps became extremely important\u00a0I found Mike Blumenthal at his blog\u00a0 (<a href=\"http:\/\/blumenthals.com\/blog\">http:\/\/www.blumenthals.com\/blog<\/a> ).\u00a0 Nobody who publishes and discusses these things publicly\u00a0is more knowledgable than Mike.\u00a0 IMO there are 3 groups that know Google Maps best:<\/p>\n<p>A.\u00a0 Google Maps engineers\u00a0 (they get surprised by things)<\/p>\n<p>B.\u00a0 Google Maps spammers\u00a0 (there is a lot of money in effectively spamming Google Maps and it is\u00a0probably currently easier than\u00a0spamming <a href=\"http:\/\/google.com\">google.com<\/a> )<\/p>\n<p>C.\u00a0 Mike.\u00a0 He sees more issues, is made aware of more issues, and studies them harder than anyone else.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the hardest type of listing you have had to deal with in local search i.e. What was the biggest issue?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A competitive site is simply the hardest.\u00a0 Whether its regular SEO or local, if the topic is competitive its hard.\u00a0 That is like anything.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite, and least favorite, part about local seo?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I enjoy it when my sites are ranking high and I least like it when my sites fall behind those of competitors.\u00a0 I also like that there is a comaraderie and a sharing of knowledge and experience from among a group of commentators in local SEO.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you do in your free time?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ha ha.\u00a0 As you&#8217;ve noted on twitter, under my twitter screen name;\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/localoptimizer\">twitter.com\/localoptimizer<\/a> I try and Razz and argue with <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/skitzzo\">@Skitzzo<\/a>, somebody I got to know earlier at SEO forums.\u00a0 He has a good sense of humor.\u00a0 I enjoy family, cooking, and sports.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In your opinion what is Google doing wrong with local search and what are they doing right?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google has a monopolistic position in search and in local search.\u00a0 In local search the market share monopoly might be greater than in regular search.\u00a0 By inputting 7pacs, 3pacs, and\u00a01boxes in regular search Google dominates that landscape at probably a higher ratio than its\u00a0share of basic search in that it gives 3 sets of\u00a0responses:\u00a0 PPC, organic search, and a highly visable Map that overwhelms the real estate of the search page.\u00a0 With that monopolistic control over search volume it has large responsibility in getting things right.\u00a0 When things aren&#8217;t right consumers get abused and the competitive nature of business is dramatically impacted.\u00a0 A spammer can get away with murder in what has become the primary source for finding local businesses.<\/p>\n<p>On the abuse side there is the prime example of locksmiths.\u00a0 Certain locksmiths spammed Google Maps, yellow page sites, etc. It all resulted in high G Maps rankings. Ultimately some of\u00a0those same locksmith spammers have been prosecuted for defrauding customers.\u00a0 Google could have eliminated the locksmith spammers at an early stage.\u00a0 It didn&#8217;t.\u00a0 You could suggest that by inaction it might have enabled the spammers to engage in some of that fraud.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest challenge facing local search?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I guess its all in the eyes of the user.\u00a0 G Maps dominates local search currently.\u00a0 I believe it uses algo&#8217;s that need lots of tweaking&#8230;not unlike Google.com has needed over the years to combat spamming\/overt and significant manipulation.\u00a0\u00a0 G Maps needs to put more manpower into cleaning up these problems.<\/p>\n<p>SMBS need to get a better handle on the power of local search.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you spending much time with Bing local? Do you think they have a shot at competing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Not yet.\u00a0 I have no idea if they will be a significant competitor to Google Maps.\u00a0 I hope it occurs.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t believe a monopoly is a healthy thing, especially for SMB&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can you give us an idea of what you think 2010-2011 hold in store for local search?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not good at predicting things, but I&#8217;d suspect that Facebook, because of its enormous traffic is going to figure out ways to monetize its opportunity in Local.\u00a0 It recently started sending preliminary stats to owners of fan pages.\u00a0 That is a start beyond ads.\u00a0 I&#8217;d say, watch Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>I hope Bing makes inroads.\u00a0 As an advertiser it means more money.\u00a0 On the other hand I think the dangers of a monopoly are worse though.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the best advice you would give someone that is wanting to learn about local seo?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d start by reading <a href=\"http:\/\/blumenthals.com\/blog\">Mike Blumenthal&#8217;s blog<\/a> from start to finish.\u00a0 Now I&#8217;ll get in trouble if I don&#8217;t start referencing every other great piece of writing on local, especially from some excellent local SEO&#8217;s that I like and consider friends.<\/p>\n<p>In reading Mike&#8217;s blog, pay attention to the sources he uses for information.\u00a0 Then start following that trail.\u00a0 Pretty soon one will start accessing most of the great writings and thinking on local search.<\/p>\n<p><!--EndFragment--><strong>Thanks a ton EarlPearl for your insights and taking part in this series!
