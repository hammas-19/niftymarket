Here are some helpful tips on how to clean this up so that prospective clients turn into new and returning clients.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Contact Forms<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This area is like the Yellow Brick Road between new customers and putting more money in your pockets. If this area is broken and un-engaging, customers will feel turned off and will try to find someone that fills that void.\u00a0 The last thing you want is to not have the prospective client feel like they\u2019re submitting information as if they were filling out a job application or trying to get a new credit card.\u00a0 In other words make sure your <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slaw.ca\/2011\/09\/13\/law-firm-website-contact-forms\/\">forms are short and sweet<\/a>!\u00a0 Include the following for the best results:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name<\/li>\n<li>Phone Number<\/li>\n<li>Email<\/li>\n<li>Best Time to Call Back<\/li>\n<li>Additional Comments (Incident Information)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Although some lawyer\u2019s don\u2019t all agree on the value of contact forms, that value actually exists. <em>(Many believe that contact forms push a prospective client away because the time between when they enter their information and the firm getting back to them is way too long.\u00a0 They see this as an area that needs to be checked daily, if not multiple times through out the day.)\u00a0 <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>And while I disagree with their dislike of having a contact form onsite, they can make the form completely responsive by having it alert their smartphone or their assistant\u2019s phone that a form has been filled out.\u00a0 People anymore need and want to be responded to quickly.\u00a0 Without this type of attention, prospective clients will just go on to the next business that will give them the time of day.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The contact form below is of one I found and really like.\u00a0 It\u2019s not too demanding for the prospective client to fill out but still they are able to give enough information to either warrant help or not.\u00a0 Especially pleasing was the disclaimer note that was included below the form itself.\u00a0 Letting people know about the attorney\/client relationship is key, but also requiring them to click that they have read the disclaimer I think is a good idea.\u00a0 Me personally, I would have included the word \u201cunderstand\u201d in \u201cI have read the disclaimer\u201d check box but that\u2019s my honest opinion.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Screen-Shot-2014-06-03-at-12.07.39-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Screen-Shot-2014-06-03-at-12.07.39-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-06-03 at 12.07.39 PM\" width=\"635\" height=\"794\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-737\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This can be tricky as with contact forms, many of the websites viewed only included one disclaimer on only one page and sometimes there wasn\u2019t a disclaimer at all.\u00a0 Now this may be ok in the eyes of your basic SEO manager, but for your own protection a disclaimer should be on all pages that include any legal information and not legal advice.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The most important thing I\u2019ve seen is that you have to let readers know that any content onsite is and only is \u201clegal information\u201d and should not be held as legal advise from the lawyer.\u00a0 Another important factor is data submitted via a contact form is NOT seen as confidential information.\u00a0 On top of that, just because there was some sort of communication established between you and whoever responded to your contact form, doesn\u2019t mean an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.americanbar.org\/groups\/professional_responsibility\/publications\/model_rules_of_professional_conduct\/rule_1_18_duties_of_prospective_client.html\">attorney\/client relationship<\/a> has been formed.\u00a0 Misleading any prospective clients is a great way to loose online appeal too.\u00a0 <em>(Reviews for business listings online are increasing in volume and this way of \u201cword of mouth\u201d could destroy those companies who may be involved in providing misleading information.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Referencing this message will save you from any future headaches.\u00a0 Don\u2019t think because that disclaimer isn\u2019t included you\u2019re automatically safe.\u00a0 The last way you want to appear to customers is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.americanbar.org\/groups\/professional_responsibility\/publications\/model_rules_of_professional_conduct\/rule_7_1_communication_concerning_a_lawyer_s_services.html\">inherently misleading.<\/a>\u00a0 See an example contact form below.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Contact-Form-Disclaimer.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/Contact-Form-Disclaimer.jpeg\" alt=\"Contact Form Disclaimer\" width=\"727\" height=\"268\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-738\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Each state will have a different set of rules when concerning the placement and content of your disclaimers.\u00a0 Some states prohibit a firm from making statements that might give a reader or prospective client misleading information on a result of a case or particular types of cases.\u00a0 In the states where this applies, information containing \u201cresults aren\u2019t typical\u201d should be included in your disclaimer.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For example in California, under Rule of the California Rules of Professional Conduct<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/rules.calbar.ca.gov\/Rules\/RulesofProfessionalConduct\/CurrentRules\/Rule1400.aspx\">Rule 1-400(D)(4)<\/a> <em>\u201c<\/em><em>the attorney&#8217;s communication or solicitation must clearly, expressly, or by context indicate the information is merely a communication or solicitation, so the viewer does not misconstrue the information as a legal relationship or legal advice.\u201d<\/em>\u00a0 And in Texas, Under <a href=\"http:\/\/www.texasbar.com\/AM\/Template.cfm?Section=Mandatory_Submission_Steps1&amp;Template=\/CM\/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=11897\">Rule 7.04(q) of the TDRPC<\/a>, <em>\u201cevery disclaimer or disclosure must be presented with equal prominence, legibility and in the same manner as the content on the website being disclaimed or disclosed so the viewer&#8217;s expectations are not mislead as to the attorney&#8217;s skill and the results the attorney can achieve.\u201d<\/em>\u00a0 You\u2019ll want to check your state\u2019s bar association and professional conduct rules to see if your website is meets all of their requirements.<\/p>\n<p><a
