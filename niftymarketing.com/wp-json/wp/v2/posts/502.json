I was born and raised in Burley, Idaho. Now that might not mean anything to you other than potatoes, but I love my small town. Burley, pop. 10,000 is the small town in the movies that never changes. We still have barber shops on our main street. I just went to our county fair, and watched people ride a mechanical bull.<\/p>\n<p>Now that sounds funny for a person to write about where they came from as part of a &#8220;who am I&#8221; section. But, this town is a big reason I do what I do. I learned to work hard here because that is the only type of work there was. I learned that reputation is everything and a good name is built on good deeds and a smile. And, most importantly I learned that success in life is based on the circle of people you can influence for the better.<!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>What is my purpose?<\/h2>\n<p>When I went to college to learn business, it became quite apparent that if I was going to excel in the business world, I would never be able to live in a small town. That bothered me so much, because I simply wanted to raise my family where I was raised. To give them that country experience that I had. So, I got creative. I talked around, I thought of business models that could bring income in from an outside area and benefit a struggling town. That is when the idea for Nifty Marketing was born. I wanted to help small businesses in small and large towns to find a way to stay open, to provide for their family&#8217;s, and to keep up with the ever confusing world of technology.<\/p>\n<h2>My Vision<\/h2>\n<p>Now I haven&#8217;t seen angels, nor have I dreamed of a giant empire, but when I decided to go ahead with Nifty Marketing, things fell into place. Though my business is young, I have helped business owners make the leap to the online world and I have loved every minute of it.<\/p>\n<p>My goal is to become a leading expert on local search. Local is who I am, what I do, where I live, and what keeps places like Burley, Idaho alive.<\/p>\n<p>So, I present to you&#8230;<a title=\"The Nifty Way to Get Online\" href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\">Nifty marketing<\/a>, the nifty way to get online.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Well, chances of this post getting read by anyone other than myself are slim, but I am a huge believer in the saying &#8220;By small and simple things, great things are brought to pass.&#8221; Who am I?
