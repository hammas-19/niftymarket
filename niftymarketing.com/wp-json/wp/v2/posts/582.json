Today we are hearing from another North Westerner that is an up and coming power house in Local Search. That man is <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ed_reese\">Ed Reese<\/a>, the authority on <a title=\"The Ed\" href=\"http:\/\/sixthmanmarketing.com\">Spokane SEO<\/a>. He is the big\u00a0chief\u00a0behind <a href=\"http:\/\/sixthmanmarketing.com\/blog\">Sixth Man Marketing<\/a>, a regular speaker at <a href=\"http:\/\/getlisted.org\/university\/faculty.aspx#reese\">Getlisted University<\/a>, and an all around great guy to know in the local search industry.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you initially get involved with internet marketing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I actually remember the exact moment. \u00a0I was producing online videos and training modules for Check Point Software and knew that our clients loved them and used them as sales tools. \u00a0But at every internal marketing meeting my videos would get bashed compared to the almighty white paper. \u00a0So I bought our IT guy some beers to generate a report (which took 3 days back in 2002) to figure out what was really driving lead generation. \u00a0My videos were generated 3X the leads as the whitepapers. \u00a0\u201cHa!\u201d I was hooked.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What made you loco for Local?<br \/>\n<\/strong><br \/>\nIt was just so incredibly underserved. \u00a0I still have no idea why more people aren\u2019t paying attention to local search. \u00a0I remember going to SMX West in 2008 wanting to hear what the experts had to say about local search (cue crickets chirping). \u00a0There was nothing! \u00a0I knew I had to start experimenting with local myself. \u00a0I was also fortunate enough to find a few marketers that were starting to publish about local search. \u00a0I read their blogs, tested techniques, tested again, and then came up with a few of my own.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have someone who has helped you along the way in learning local?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have been very fortunate in that regard. \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/davidmihm.com\">David Mihm<\/a> was one of the very first people I met in search. \u00a0His help and professional encouragement has been invaluable for me. \u00a0I also connected early with other great local search sensai\u2019s at SMX Local in San Franciso the Summer of 2008 and have followed them ever since. \u00a0That\u2019s where I met <a href=\"http:\/\/blumenthals.com\/blog\">Mike Blumenthal<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marybowling.com\/\">Mary Bowling<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nodalbits.com\/\">Chris Silver Smit<\/a>h, <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/golander59\">Gib Olander<\/a>, and others that have really helped my local search education.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about your consulting firm up in Spokane, <a title=\"Ed's Little Space on the Web\" href=\"http:\/\/sixthmanmarketing.com\">Sixth Man Marketing<\/a>? How did you come up with the name?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The name was the product of a 5 minute brainstorming session with my wife. \u00a0I\u2019m a basketball fan, so my first thought was to use some sort of basketball term or metaphor as a name. \u00a0Companies hire me to assist in marketing challenges on the fly. \u00a0So it felt like I was the sixth man coming off the bench into the game. \u00a0Also, \u201cSlam\u201d was already taken.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You recently paved the way for the first ever <a href=\"http:\/\/getlisted.org\/university\">GetListed University<\/a> event that debuted in Spokane. Can you explain how the concept came about, and the process of putting the event on.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It was something David Mihm and Pat Sexton of GetListed had been thinking about for a while (putting on a local search series). \u00a0I got involved by talking with David at an after-party at the SEOmoz Advanced Training last August. \u00a0After a few beers, I said \u201cI\u2019m tired of having go to San Jose, Seattle, Las Vegas, etc., for conferences. \u00a0Let\u2019s do one in Spokane.\u201d David called me last November to remind me of my beer-fueled commitment and before you know it we\u2019ve got LocalU in Spokane.<\/p>\n<p>The process was quite an undertaking. \u00a0I\u2019d never put on a conference before, so I really had no idea what to expect. \u00a0Our team (David Mihm, Mary Bowling, Matt McGee, Mike Blumenthal, Pat Sexton, &amp; myself) collaborated regarding content, logistics, and overall conference planning. \u00a0But I was responsible for the local side of things, which included the venue, creating marketing partnerships, and ultimately getting butts in the seats.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nYour a big fan of using stick drawings in a couple presentations I have seen you do. What\u2019s the deal?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I embrace my complete lack of artistic talent. \u00a0It started pretty randomly. \u00a0I had some hand-drawn notes that I\u2019d asked my wife (a graphic designer) to make look professional and put into Power Point. \u00a0She said my stick figure drawings matched my personality and presentation style and said I should just go with it. \u00a0I actually think she was just trying to get out of doing the slides for me, but I\u2019ve been going with the stick figure thing ever since and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sixthmanmarketing.com\/spokaneclub\">it\u2019s become my signature presentation style<\/a>. \u00a0People would be really surprised at how long it takes me to draw my stick figure presentations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite, and least favorite, part about being a local seo consultant?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I love the work, the testing, the research, and the results. \u00a0I\u2019m really fortunate to have found something I\u2019m passionate about that I get paid to do. \u00a0Sure, I\u2019m not a professional athlete (that would\u2019ve been my first choice), but it\u2019s pretty sweet. \u00a0No complaints here.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I know you are a big fan of analytics and reporting.
