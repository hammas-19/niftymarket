I feel like I&#8217;d need more prodding to use the black bar of results.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Amanda<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; &#8220;i love it! once i figured out what it was&#8230;i&#8217;m a visual person so it gives you a lot of information with just a glance&#8230;i like it! &#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Craig &#8211;<\/strong> &#8220;The visual component almost makes you salivate. It&#8217;s a nice result compared to text only. It immediately made me think of the type of food I might want to check out, as opposed to just names.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Aidan &#8211;<\/strong>\u00a0&#8220;I didn&#8217;t even really notice it to tell you the truth. I would have to see it again&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Happy<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; &#8220;I would rather that search results are associated with a website like zagat that have a level of credibility and a name brand in rating restaurants. The carousel may have been populated via many ways; I am not sure what methodology has gone into populating it. If the carousel results had their source website name on it, i would have clicked on the results.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Salman &#8211;<\/strong> \u00a0&#8220;Often times, a simple google search doesn&#8217;t provide a visual component to their web search. This carousel allows for quick viewing of a wide array of search results so that the viewer can find what they&#8217;re looking for in a more time-efficient manner. This way, fewer links need to be opened in order to find what the viewer is searching for, while at the same time, the viewer ends up absorbing even more media in that shorter amount of time. On the whole, I think that the carousel is a great upgrade. &#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Venita<\/strong>\u00a0&#8211; &#8220;I noticed that a carousel of images had been added to the top of the page and that is very helpful. since I am a visual person and I love modern then the carousel will help me to eliminate the places that I would not like to visit. I LOVE the new layout.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Carli &#8211;<\/strong>\u00a0&#8220;It was slightly different and interesting, but I clearly went for the old school method of search results over the fancy new one. =)&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Paul &#8211;<\/strong> &#8220;It&#8217;s totally cool &#8211; but the only thing I&#8217;m suspicious about as a user is what&#8217;s driving the results &#8212; I don&#8217;t see any way to &#8220;fine tune&#8221; my search by cusine, price, etc&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Some of the More Interesting Videos of People Viewing Carousel Results<\/h2>\n<p>I\u00a0recommend\u00a0watching the videos below to get an idea of how people look at search results.
