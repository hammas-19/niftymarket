Let&#8217;s dive in. When changes happen I like to run whatever tests I can to understand the effects. While these click through rate studies don&#8217;t represent every search phrase, they sure do give us some interesting things to think about. For each of these we asked <strong>100 individuals<\/strong> a variation of the following question:<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Pretend you needed an (industry)\u00a0in (location). On a (Desktop\/mobile device)\u00a0you searched for &#8220;(Google Search Phrase)&#8221; and got the following search result.

At Nifty, we moved away from a laser focus on maps and really focused on growing organic traffic for phrases that show map results and phrases that don&#8217;t and overall we have had great increases of traffic across clients. Local packs change so often that I think its a fools errand to chase them as the end all be all and have been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/2015\/07\/30\/seos-believe-high-local-rankings-deliver-greater-response-than-organic\/\">saying that for a while<\/a>.

A grey button is the only way to get to the website from this page.The\u00a0phone number and address are no longer visible from the local pack in the serps and are somewhat minimized on this page. Meanwhile, Google&#8217;s sponsored local listing pack (received the most total paid clicks out of all our tests) which showcases the phone number&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3312\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Screenshot-2015-08-11-14.30.24.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-08-11 14.30.24\" width=\"574\" height=\"360\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Takes you this page&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3313\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Screenshot-2015-08-11-14.32.10-1024x629.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-08-11 14.32.10\" width=\"600\" height=\"369\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Which\u00a0minimizes individual reviews compared to aggregate score and also removes those pesky competitors.<\/p>\n<p>My bet is that\u00a0some version of this is going to roll out across a whole lot more than locksmiths and plumbers. And if a business has the choice to pay google to remove competitors, hide individual reviews, and potentially guarantee\u00a0a top map position then I think Google is going to make a lot of money.<\/p>\n<h3>Every Review Matters<\/h3>\n<p>Check out this local finder listing page:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3314\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Screenshot-2015-08-11-14.48.56-1024x604.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-08-11 14.48.56\" width=\"600\" height=\"354\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can see a break down review summary and some reviews are highlighted. <a href=\"http:\/\/rovepestcontrol.com\">Rove<\/a> has a 4.2 rating (greaet) but it&#8217;s obvious they have a couple 2 and 1 star reviews along with a highlighted negative phrase. Businesses will have to go the extra mile to ensure they are getting a constant rotation of reviews and hope that Google updates the &#8220;highlighted&#8221; reviews often. As you can see Arrow (competitor) have 5 stars and that might look really good if people don&#8217;t like what they read about Rove. This experience replaces traffic that went right to the website and definitely doesn&#8217;t favor the business. The Jury is still out on if consumers will like this more than a company website.<\/p>\n<p>Also, look at the mobile test on Provo Storage Units. I was shocked that U-haul performed so poorly on mobile.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3315\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Screenshot-2015-08-11-15.01.44.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-08-11 15.01.44\" width=\"312\" height=\"651\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>But look at AAA star rating. It&#8217;s a full star higher than U-Haul and that seems like the ONLY logical reason for the clicks. U-haul performed a lot better on desktop:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3316\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Screenshot-2015-08-11-15.05.03.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-08-11 15.05.03\" width=\"613\" height=\"564\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There is definitely a lot more grabbing attention here compared to mobile. It would be interesting to know if reviews pull more\u00a0attention on mobile than desktop.<\/p>\n<h3>3 Listings Is Not a Lot<\/h3>\n<p>Getting into the top 7 was hard. 3 is a freaking joke. Yet again, organic first, local pack second. It&#8217;s also the number of ads above organic (coincidence or foreshadow), and its the number of paid sponsor test listings in San Fransisco right now.<\/p>\n<h3>Study the organic listings that did get clicks<\/h3>\n<p>A few things I saw that were interesting:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;cheap&#8221; in title tag or description on the\u00a0storage unit search phrases performed really well.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;best&#8221; in title tag or description\u00a0on the law search phrases performed well.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Do your own click studies<\/h3>\n<p>While I do believe you can learn a lot from these studies its 3 search phrases across two sizes. I think that every industry and search phrase will have different results. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provo Storage paid ads were 42% on mobile<\/li>\n<li>Boise Lawyer paid ads were 20% on mobile<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>That is a big difference and if we only looked at one study our data might be way off. Two at least shows the difference and allows you to try and understand why. I use <a href=\"https:\/\/usabilityhub.com\/\">UsabilityHub<\/a> and love it. It&#8217;s why I also love when <a href=\"https:\/\/jurisdigital.com\/click-study-the-new-3-pack-where-users-are-clicking\/\">cool kids like Casey Meraz do their own to compare against\u00a0as well<\/a>.
