Doing this helps me understand the types of questions people are searching for regarding a particular topic. This is also a great way to develop FAQ content ideas for your website. While researching topics to cover about copyright issues &amp; trying to dial into common concerns, I came across some interesting questions that Google autocomplete showed me people are searching. As you can see from the autocomplete variations below, there are a lot of people concerned about various aspects of copyright infringement. A fair amount of these searches are generated from people trying to better understand copyright laws &amp; how they apply to what they are currently doing in their business or on their websites, such as how they are using imagery. Others are related to obtaining &amp; enforcing copyrights for creative works, and even how to dodge particular copyright issues.<\/span> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4575\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/AutocompleteScreenshots.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"294\" \/><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After looking through many variations of autocomplete suggestions like these, it seems that many more people are searching how to avoid \u00a0problems with copyrights laws than those who are searching for how to enforce them. This could lead one to believe that there is a relatively small number of people scaring the hell out of a much larger group of people with the threat of some type of action against them. And, for good reason. Nobody wants to end up in a legal battle over the use of an image on a blog post. Looking further into the keyword volume, there are actually quite a few people looking for information on how to obtain a copyright for different creative works. This won\u2019t be the focus of this post, but we\u2019ll also briefly touch on a couple points in relation to that in the Q&amp;A section.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4577 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/How-to-get-copyright-keywords.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"819\" height=\"254\" \/><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The real focus here is on \u201chow to avoid copyright infringement\u201d, which a fair amount of people are also interested in and searching for (&amp; probably many more long-tail variations).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4578 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Avoiding-copyright-infringement-keyword.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"849\" height=\"39\" \/><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how do you avoid copyright infringement? The best rule of thumb I\u2019ve learned up to this point is to <strong>assume everything is under copyright protection unless specifically stated that it is not<\/strong>. There\u2019s a lot of widely held assumptions that you can use images in certain places and under certain circumstances, but many of these assumptions are simply false. Let\u2019s look at a few more general rules you can follow that should help you avoid lawsuits &amp; headaches down the road.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>1. Know if you have permission<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t know for sure if you have permission to use an image, and it\u2019s not specifically stated somewhere that the image is for commercial use and\/or royalty free, don\u2019t use it. It\u2019s not worth the potential risk. Some <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shiftcomm.com\/blog\/copyright-101-basics-avoiding-content-marketing-lawsuits\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">basic things about copyright law<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you should understand are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Copyright is automatic and when someone produces a creative work, ordinarily copyright applies.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For further protection under the law, the creator of the work can register that work with the copyright office.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The existence or nonexistence of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.copyright.gov\/circs\/circ01.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">copyright symbol<\/a> is not required nor does it mean that the copyright has not been registered at the U.S. Copyright Office.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><b>2. Understand that most of what you do will likely be commercial in nature<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a marketer, pretty much everything you do for your own business (and for your clients) will be commercial in nature. It\u2019s likely not worth trying to decipher if <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.copyright.gov\/fair-use\/more-info.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fair Use<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> might apply when it comes to using copyrighted information because more than likely, it won\u2019t. There are exceptions to this, but even the exceptions are subject to a court&#8217;s interpretation of the copyright when deciding if the use was &#8220;fair&#8221; For example, using copyrighted elements in something like an infographic may be considered a &#8220;transformative&#8221; work because it takes on a new meaning &amp; use. But even then, the amount of copyrighted work within it as well as a number of other factors would likely be considerations made by a court. This is why it\u2019s better to err on the side of caution when it comes to commercial use of anything which you suspect may be copyrighted content.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>3. Utilize stock imagery<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The safest imagery you can use (outside of images you\u2019ve shot or created yourself) will most likely come from paid stock sites. Using stock images can help you avoid costly legal fees related to copyright issues. Stock media companies have a financial interest in keeping their customers safe from ungrounded copyright claims. Obviously, it\u2019s not good for their business if people try to start copyright lawsuits against people who\u2019ve legally obtained &amp; paid for stock media, so it\u2019s in their best interest to protect their customers. <strong>This is done through agreements with the photographers &amp; creatives that work with them &amp; produce the media for sale on their sites.<\/strong> Some of my personal favorite stock sites include: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.colourbox.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colourbox<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.istockphoto.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iStock<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.shutterstock.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shutterstock<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>4. Exercise more caution with free images<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When using any free image sites, make sure that the image is free for commercial use, and\/or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/pikwizard.com\/blog\/what-does-royalty-free-mean?utm_source=blog&#038;utm_medium=content%20link&#038;utm_campaign=PW%20what%20does%20royalty%20free%20mean\" rel=\"noopener\">royalty free<\/a> &amp; also be positive that you are attributing correctly if it is required for use. You may want to lean away from usage that does require attribution if you feel it diminishes the professional quality of the use to have the attribution with the image (some requirements vary). If you do use free imagery from anywhere, you should consider <strong>documenting some things as a precaution<\/strong> just in case something were ever to come up from usage of the image:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a). <strong>Document the url<\/strong> where the image was available for download.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">b). <strong>Document the date<\/strong> you found the image available.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">c). <strong>Catalog this documentation<\/strong> in a way that will be easy to find &amp; sort through at a later date if ever needed. If you\u2019re doing this for many clients on a regular basis, things can get quite messy pretty quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">d). <strong>Remember that different sites have different rules<\/strong> for image use. Flickr\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/people\/free_for_commercial_use\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free For Commercial Use license<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> still requires attribution. And no, not all images on Flickr are okay to reuse.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>5. Check licensing details<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though stock images are a safer bet for image use, just because you\u2019re downloading images a stock site and paying for the image, does NOT guarantee that you can do anything you want with them. You especially need to be aware of each site\u2019s licensing terms &amp; understand what type of use each license allows. Most stock image sites also have a large number of \u201ceditorial\u2019 images (sometimes more than not) which are not suitable for commercial purposes. This is an detail to pay attention to when using stock images. Here\u2019s some things to to help decipher what licensing usage is available on a few stock image sites: <\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>iStock:<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you click on an image you\u2019re considering purchasing, here\u2019s how to tell if the image is defaulted to the standard license or if it is for editorial use only:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4585 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Istock-Licenses.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"434\" \/><\/p>\n<h4><b>Shutterstock:<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again here\u2019s where to look for standard license vs editorial use (only after clicking on an image)<\/span>:<\/p>\n<h4><b><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4583 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Shutterstock-Editorial.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"343\" \/>Colourbox: <\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you click on an image to download on Colourbox, this is what is shown to the right side of that image and how you can tell between the licensing options<\/span>:<\/p>\n<p><b><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4584 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/ColorBox-Licenses.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"581\" \/><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three of these sites show this information to the right when clicking on the image you intend to download.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most sites will specify somewhere what their licenses mean but may require some researching. For example, Colourbox outlines what <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.colourbox.com\/faq#S_what_is_editorial_material\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">editorial images can be used for here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They also go into some detail about what can and cannot be defined as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.colourbox.com\/supplier-wiki\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201croyalty free\u201d here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I would highly recommend anyone <a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\">involved in marketing<\/a>, design or <a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/services\/local-seo-services\/\">seo<\/a> to take a look at that last link. It discusses a number of things I believe most of us would find surprising such as things which cannot ever be photographed or reproduced for any purpose besides editorial use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some sites have ways the user can filter for stock or editorial images during a search, but be careful to still check the license on every image, as these searches can be misleading. For example, Colourbox has a section for stock and another for editorial. Selecting \u201cstock\u201d does NOT eliminate editorial. Rather, it just includes editorial <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> royalty free images in the search. Selecting editorial refines the search to only editorial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4588 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Colourbox-Search.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"988\" height=\"306\" \/><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shutterstock seems to function similarly to Colourbox, whereas, on iStock, refining the search to \u201ccreative\u201d does seem to weed out editorial images. It is still wise, however, to not just rely on this entirely and to check each image license to be sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4587 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Istock-Creative-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"518\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are also limitations to most licensing. For example, a regular license may only cover a certain amount of views or specified amount of time. Some sites offer extended licenses for further freedoms of image usage. For example, iStock requires an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.istockphoto.com\/help\/licenses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Extended License<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for any physical products or items for sale (like posters, postcards, mugs, t-shirts) and also require an <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlimited Reproduction License<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for things that may be copied many times over (like newspapers, magazines or books). So, by that logic, if we were to use an image for an ebook cover, we\u2019d probably need something more than the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standard License<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Even then, this wouldn\u2019t cover <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.istockphoto.com\/legal\/license-agreement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">image use in a logo design<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Shutterstock seems to be a bit more lenient with the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.shutterstock.com\/license\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standard License<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as they do specifically state that it covers books &amp; e-books as long as the audience or reproduction is 500k or less. It does prohibit things like templates or use in ways that would be considered reselling. Shutterstock\u2019s <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">enhanced license<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is significantly more expensive but does offer further legal protection &amp; unlimited reproductions as well as the ability to make templates &amp; use images in some ways that would be considered \u201creselling\u201d (such as greeting cards, magnets, textiles, etc., items that are not a single image use but rather where the image is utilized to sell another product).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Still Have Questions?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, there are some of the basics as I understand them from my own research, though I\u2019m by no means a legal expert on this topic. You should do your own due diligence &amp; make sure you understand the legalities of exactly how you intend to use material that isn\u2019t of your own creation to avoid copyright issues. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The information covered above is really just the tip of the iceberg. You may still have a lot of unanswered questions &#8211; I know I did after doing a fair amount of research into the subject.

Whether a use is commercial or not will likely mean much more to the copyright holder.

How murky is that water to navigate? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201dThe big parody case concerns a commercial use. <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Campbell_v._Acuff-Rose_Music,_Inc\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Campbell_v._Acuff-Rose_Music,_Inc<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. so it\u2019s certainly available for commercial claims. The big trick to using it is knowing the difference between parody and satire and how they\u2019re treated differently. For example, in the Too Live Crew case, the use of the copyrighted work was to poke fun of the work itself and the antiquated sexual norms (at least that\u2019s how the Court took it) so that\u2019s parody. On the other hand, if I take the same work and twist the lyrics so I\u2019m making fun of a politician, that\u2019s more likely to be satire since I\u2019m making fun of someone or something different from the copyrighted work itself.

However, a search of the online catalog is limited in the case of compilations or collections of copyrighted works. Individual works that were published as contributions to a compilation are usually not listed separately by title in the Copyright Office\u2019s records and deposits (which are copies of the copyrighted works provided to the Copyright Office) are not open to the public for searching. So, in order to verify that a single image is part of the registered compilation, a person would need to either: (1) visit the copyright card catalog, which is located in the Copyright Public Records Reading Room (LM-404) on the fourth floor of the James Madison Memorial Building of the Library of Congress, and pay a search fee to review the deposit submitted as part of the compilation\u2019s registration, or (2) request a member of the Copyright Office staff search the copyright records for you. An hourly fee is charged for searches conducted by the Copyright Office staff who will provide you with a factual report.

Is one of your competitors comparing your goods\/services to theirs? That is comparative advertising, and it is generally permissible. However, all comparative advertisements must be truthful and must not be deceptive. Truthful comparative advertisements are beneficial to consumers and can help them make good purchasing decisions. In short, if you want to create a comparative advertisement and avoid any pitfalls, be honest, accurate, and truthful.<br \/>\n<span><\/span><br \/>\nComparative advertisements usually highlight measurable characteristics between goods\/services, such as price. However, other metrics can be used, including comparing speed of service, better taste, quality of product, etc. in comparative advertisements.<br \/>\n<span><\/span><br \/>\nComparative advertisements are governed by a variety of regulations and laws. However, the main ones are The Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) and Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. 1125(a) (aka the \u201cTrademark Act\u201d)). Your advertisement may attack or criticize a competitor\u2019s goods\/services as long as your statements are truthful and not deceptive. So, your comparison could be literally true, but it cannot be deceptive. To avoid deceptive comparisons, do not omit facts that may mislead a consumer who then makes a decision based on your misleading statement. Truthful comparative advertisements can help maintain a strong brand in your trademark.<br \/>\n<span><\/span><br \/>\nThere are multiple avenues to take when another company is improperly comparing its goods\/services in a comparative advertisement. Demand letters (including takedown requests) may be sent to both the company with the comparative advertisement and its web hosting provider or outlet where the advertisement is displayed. You may file a complaint with the FTC, but this is usually only beneficial if there is a large amount of consumer harm instead of just a dispute between two competitors. If you have national advertisements and meet certain criteria, you may file a complaint with the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. Finally, you may file a complaint in Federal Court under the Lanham Act (aka the \u201cTrademark Act\u201d). You may be entitled to injunctive relief (to stop the false advertiser from continuing to display the comparative advertisement during the case\u2014and possibly even the display of your trademark) and\/or for monetary damages to be awarded. In general, the party seeking monetary relief must prove that actual consumer deception or confusion occurred due to \u201cmaterial\u201d statements or omissions in the comparative advertisement that caused actual harm.\u201d<\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211;<\/span> <b>Answered by Craig Creeden of<\/b> <a href=\"http:\/\/lilenfeldpc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><b>Lilenfeld PC<\/b><\/a>\n<\/ol>\n<h4><b>Common Trends &#8211; Ok or Not?<\/b>:<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">YouTube Embedded Videos: any issues around this (even if it is commercial in nature)? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><\/i><b><i>Generally no<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Youtube&#8217;s user agreement outlines that pretty much anything uploaded to them is licensed to them.

However, there is an exception as a defense to a claim of copyright infringement when someone&#8217;s use of another&#8217;s copyrighted work constitutes &#8220;fair use.&#8221; The purpose of allowing for fair use is for situations &#8220;such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research.&#8221; (Section 107 of the Copyright Act). The copyright statute sets out four factors (although courts can consider other factors as well) to consider to determine if a use constitutes fair use. <\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<span><\/span><br \/>\n \t<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These four factors are:<\/span><\/i><br \/>\n \t1.) <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;<\/span><\/i><br \/>\n \t2.) <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the nature of the copyrighted work;<\/span><\/i><br \/>\n \t3.) <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and<\/span><\/i><br \/>\n \t4.) <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. Section 107 of the Copyright Act.<\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<span><\/span><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, it is not a matter of a blog being viewed as news\/editorial in nature and somewhat less commercial as a whole. It would more likely turn on whether the specific post that uses the copyrighted photo without permission constitutes fair use by conducting an analysis of the four factors above. Furthermore, it would likely matter whether the blog as a whole is commercial (i.e. is the blog owner receiving some sort of income from pageviews, etc.). The more the post is for noncommercial educational purposes, news reporting, comment, or criticism, the more likely such use would constitute fair use&#8211;especially regarding commentary of the photo itself and not just general news reporting about some item other than the copyrighted photo. If the use of the copyrighted photo is &#8220;transformative,&#8221; as in adding something new to the photo or arranging the photo in a collage, etc., the more likely the use is fair use. <\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<span><\/span><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, these issues are determined on a case-by-case basis after a detailed analysis.

Can people just get away with stealing images from everywhere because it\u2019s personal use &amp; there\u2019s typically no commercial interest? How is it different from a business pulling images for social media use? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While using a copyrighted image for personal, non-commercial use may be considered fair use, the water gets a little murky when reposting images to social media. When placing a copyrighted image on your social media page, you must be very careful to ensure your post falls within the bounds of fair use. Generally, use of a copyrighted image for purposes of criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research is fair use and not infringement.<\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<span><\/span><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In determining whether the use of a work is a fair use, the factors to be considered include: (1) the purpose and character of the use (this requires two distinct considerations: is the use commercial in nature?, and is the use \u201ctransformative\u201d? \u2014that is does it incorporate the copyrighted work into a new work that no longer resembles the original (usually done by adding new expression or commentary)); (2) the nature of the copyrighted work (i.e. is the copyrighted image a non-fictional rendering or a highly creative work?); (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole (i.e. are you just using a small portion of the image?); and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work (i.e. will your use take away from or diminish the value of the copyrighted image?). <\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<span><\/span><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the use of an image in a personal social media post may often be considered non-commercial, commentary, criticism, or transformative, this is not always the case when it comes to social media posts made by businesses or entrepreneurs.<\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<span><\/span><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, on September 11, 2013, a production assistant for the Fox News program Justice with Judge Jeanine posted the iconic photo of three firefighters raising the American flag near the ruins of the World Trade Center after the 9\/11 bombings (the \u201cWork\u201d) on the program\u2019s social media page. The Work was captured by the photojournalist Thomas E. Franklin. Fox News did not simply post a blanket copy of the Work. The image used by Fox News was different from the Work in five distinct ways. Fox News used a (1) cropped, (2) lower-resolution version of the Work, (3) which was juxtaposed with Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima and (4) in a smaller scale than the Work, and (5) added the phrase \u201c#neverforget.\u201d The photographer sued for copyright infringement and Fox News claimed fair use, arguing the posting on social media was by its nature transformative because such posting can be categorized as comment, was meant to connote remembrance and participation in a global discussion of the events of 9\/11, and used a derivative image that combined the Work with Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima. The district court rejected the argument and held that the posting was not a fair use. In so holding, the district court noted the Work was the predominant feature of the post; the image used by Fox News altered the content and message of the Work, but only minimally; and the court questioned whether the commentary Fox News wished to convey (i.e. #neverforget) created anything new or transformative. The court also found that a question existed as to whether Fox News made the post for the purely expressive purpose of commenting on the events of September 11, 2001, or whether it did so for the commercial purpose of promoting the Justice with Judge Jeanine program. Based on the above, the district court found that the social media post was not fair use. North Jersey Media Group Inc. v. Jeanine Pirro and Fox News Network, LLC, 74 F.Supp.3d 605 (S.D.N.Y. 2015).<\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<span><\/span><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, when posting an image to social media you should consider all four fair use factors, particularly whether your post transforms the original image and whether the post can be considered commercial in nature. If in doubt, the best practice and general rule of thumb when using copyrighted works is to obtain permission from the rights owner prior to your use. Claiming that its just Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or another social media outlet is not a legal defense to copyright infringement.\u201d<\/span><\/i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211;<\/span> <b>Answered by Kaitlyn Haase of<\/b> <a href=\"http:\/\/lilenfeldpc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><b>Lilenfeld PC<\/b><\/a><\/li>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Are there any instances of logo reproduction that you do not need permission for?

Now the stock photo site is threatening a lawsuit if he doesn\u2019t pay a couple thousand for each photo he used without giving attribution.\u201d<\/span><\/i> <b>\u2013 Provided by Steve O\u2019Donnell of<\/b> <a href=\"http:\/\/3cpatents.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><b>3C Patents<\/b><\/a><\/li>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<li><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne area of copyright law that is unfamiliar to the general population and attorneys alike is that of Copyright Management Information under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which is information that identifies, inter alia, the owner of the work, terms and conditions for using the work, and other, helpful information. This section of the law creates a cause of action if a person without authority, inter alia, removes or alters this information. For example, in a cringeworthy situation we\u2019ve seen, a professional photograph available online may identify the owner of the work at the bottom righthand corner of the work. If a person, without authority, removes this information and uploads a copy of the photograph to his or her website for sale to others, that same person may not have only exposed himself or herself to a claim for copyright infringement, but may now have exposed himself or herself to a completely different section of the Copyright Act for statutory damages ranging from $200.00 to $2,500.00. As such, it\u2019s important to be mindful of cropping photographs and other protected works to remove the identity of a copyright owner.\u201d<\/span><\/i> <b>\u2013 Provided by Robert Powers of<\/b> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mcplegal.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>McClanahan Powers, PLLC<\/b><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><b>In Conclusion: Marketers\u2026 Don\u2019t Be Lazy, It Will Likely Come Back To Bite You.<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re thinking that using an image here &amp; there for a website shouldn\u2019t be problematic, think again. It\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll end up documenting every single image you use &amp; where it came from. So by the time this becomes an issue, the images you used that were questionable as to copyright status, will be mixed in where you will no longer remember. Then a year or two (maybe longer) down the road when a copyright holder contacts the site owner, demanding money and the quality of your work comes into question, it will dawn on you why this is so problematic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, there\u2019s the question of who <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">really<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is responsible for the work. While legally, it probably falls on the business\/site owner, if <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> don\u2019t fix the issue now, you will likely burn any bridges with this client right to the ground. At this point, that happy client who may have sent you business or gave you a good review\/testimonial becomes a very angry client (and for good reason, they hired you to be the professional). So now, you\u2019re faced with potentially paying the fee being demanded by the copyright holder as well as living with the knowledge that there\u2019s a big can of worms which is wide open. That can of worms is the other images on the website that you weren\u2019t worried about at the time you posted them. By now, you probably no longer remember which is which. Now comes the fun part: backtracking all the work you\u2019ve done in relation to images on this site. All which could have been avoided by making sure you\u2019re using images which have a copyright status appropriate for your desired use.<\/span><\/p>\n<style>\nimg{max-width: 100%; height: auto;}\n<\/style>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When I\u2019m trying to come up with ideas for content development, I like to let Google autocomplete variations of phrases with keywords related to my subject matter.
