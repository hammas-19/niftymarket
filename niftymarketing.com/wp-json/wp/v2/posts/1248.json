Sure, Mr. Lucas may have tried to dress up a newer version (and even almost succeeding in winning me over with Leia\u2019s mom) but the classics will always hold a special place in my heart.<\/p>\n<p>I can see you asking yourself now &#8211; what does this have to do with SEO?

With the advent of Search+, Google\u2019s continued mantra of \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d seems to be losing ground &#8211; and becoming an empire that people are becoming increasingly distraught with.
