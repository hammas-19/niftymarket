Here are a few tips to help you take full advantage of the holidays using SEO tactics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip 1: Get an AWESOME link building campaign<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Have you ever had an \u201cI wish that were me moment?\u201d I have, I\u2019ve had plenty. Like the time several friends were going to the Caribbean but I had to stay home, yeah, I wish that were me going. Or how about the moment when someone just got done with a triathlon, I wish that were me, I wish I was fit enough, dedicated enough to do that\u2026 but training is so hard! haha<\/p>\n<p>The other day as I was walking through the grocery store I saw a man, his clothes were torn up, he looked as if it had been a long time since he\u2019d had a shower. He had some bread, meat and a couple other small things in his hand and I noticed he was counting the change in his hand. The thing that happened next was one I will never forget. A lady approached him and asked, \u201cWould you mind if I bought those things for you?\u201d Right there and then I had one of the most powerful, \u201cI wish that were me\u201d moments. Why didn\u2019t I help someone in need? <\/p>\n<p>Now, I don\u2019t tell you this story to get sentimental but to prove a point. How many of us see others doing something, especially at this time of year, whether it be giving to the needy, going Christmas caroling, or seeing a competitor doing an awesome campaign to get well known around the community? I know you all have experienced this and your thought was, \u201cGrrr\u2026why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d aka I wish that were me moment.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/doh.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/doh.jpg\" alt=\"doh\" width=\"285\" height=\"282\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3185\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here, at Nifty Marketing, we have done a link building campaign or two for our clients. One that brings us pride and joy is one that we did last year for the holidays. We made a calendar that had all of the family Christmas related events happening in the city of Boise, Idaho.  Below is an example of the details we had for every event.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Screen-Shot-2014-12-09-at-5.11.48-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Screen-Shot-2014-12-09-at-5.11.48-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-12-09 at 5.11.48 PM\" width=\"850\" height=\"253\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3188\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>A lot of time and effort went into it, but it was well worth it for the client.<\/p>\n<p>Christmas is right around the corner, at this time of year people are out and about and they notice things that happen around town. You should already have a link campaign in place, something that will get yourself better known and hopefully, as a result, build links to your site. Start a link building campaign ASAP for the holiday, give back to the community and get noticed. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip 2: Make sure your site is optimized for mobile<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret; during Christmas people are shopping like crazy, looking for that perfect gift for their kids. I\u2019m sure they search on their mobile device while they are out wandering, for stores that might carry the newest gadget or doll. You can\u2019t go anywhere these days without seeing someone occupied on his or her phone; it\u2019s all around us. <\/p>\n<p>People also do a lot of traveling out of state or even out of the country at this time of year. Again, they will be doing their searches on mobile devices. If your products or services are needed for any situation, you want your site to be easily navigated and ready. <\/p>\n<p>The infographic below shows just how important having a mobile friendly website is.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/mobile_Infographic.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/mobile_Infographic.jpg\" alt=\"mobile_Infographic\" width=\"800\" height=\"1115\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3189\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Having your website optimized for mobile is a must in todays competitive market, and frankly, it already should be mobile friendly. But if it isn\u2019t, I suggest you rush order that being done NOW.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip 3: Optimize Content for Holiday Keywords<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s Christmas time, do you think people are going to be searching, \u201cnewest iPhone\u201d? Okay, yes they are, but some of the most highly searched terms during the holidays are things like, \u201cgifts for dad\/mom\u201d or \u201cgift ideas\u201d or how about this one, \u201ctips for surviving the holidays.\u201d Now is the time to produce awesome content on a holiday offer page or blog post. If you have these high traffic search terms in your content, you\u2019re more likely to show up for those terms, obviously, and heck, maybe even gain a customer or two.<\/p>\n<p>If you think you\u2019re the only one trying to zone in on the holiday season, you\u2019re wrong. There are millions of companies that will optimize their content for the holidays, so your goal is to create something brilliant and eye catching. While optimizing content, make them an offer they can\u2019t refuse. This could be a coupon of any kind, buy one get one free, 50% off, anything will do!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip 4: Share the Love<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/social.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/social.png\" alt=\"social\" width=\"514\" height=\"85\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3186\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This one is pretty simple, but important. After you do all this work, make sure people know about it! Social networks are huge and can spread word very fast. Facebook alone has 1.2 billion monthly active users. Remember that link building campaign I mentioned earlier? Check out how many social shares it got.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/2013-Boise-Idaho-Christmas-and-Holiday-Activities-Guide-Build-Idaho-Boise-Idaho-Homes-for-Sale-Guide.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/2013-Boise-Idaho-Christmas-and-Holiday-Activities-Guide-Build-Idaho-Boise-Idaho-Homes-for-Sale-Guide.png\" alt=\"2013 Boise Idaho Christmas and Holiday Activities Guide    Build Idaho  Boise Idaho Homes for Sale Guide\" width=\"1037\" height=\"802\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3187\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It was shared 1321 on Facebook, had 3 Google+ shares, 16 Pinterest shares, 18 Tweets and 3 LinkedIn shares. That\u2019s a total of <strong>1,361 shares<\/strong>, all of which are helping build your brand and awareness. <\/p>\n<p>In a recent study it said that the average American spends 3.2 hours a day on social media. That\u2019s a ton of time, time in which people could be seeing all the work you\u2019ve been doing. Just remember to 1) start an AWESOME link building campaign, 2) optimize your site for mobile and 3) create epic content to draw attention.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a fun time of year, so do something fun with your company to get known and build links. Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you taking advantage during the holiday season?
