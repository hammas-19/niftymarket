The concept was to try to keep everything on one page, and bring in a measurement system that would be understood by anyone that sees it. While business might not understand EVERY word, they understand where they stand and where they need to be. \u00a0There is no better system to do this than by a measurement of 0-100%.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/Screen-Shot-2012-08-15-at-3.12.07-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1678\" title=\"Screen Shot 2012-08-15 at 3.12.07 PM\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/Screen-Shot-2012-08-15-at-3.12.07-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"134\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>We created an overall score so that we can basically say, &#8220;You got a 42\/100, which means if you were in a class you would be failing&#8230;as in F&#8221; This usually has a better effect than saying, &#8220;Well your home page title tag does mention your brand name, but it doesn&#8217;t have any keyword focus at at and we would recommend restructuring that and working on your meta description as you currently don&#8217;t have one and Google is basically scraping whatever they think is relevant from your site to show in the snippet.&#8221; \u00a0(Insert glossy eye look here)<\/p>\n<p>After we lead with an overall score we break it down into 4 main areas of importance to give subscores.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sitemap (10%) \u00a0 &#8211; Crucial to ensure crawlability of your local pages.<\/li>\n<li>URL Structure\u00a0(15%) -Keyword + location based structure boosts rankings<\/li>\n<li>Local Functions\u00a0(15%) &#8211; Need a location finder to find a freaking location<\/li>\n<li>Local Landing Pages (60%) &#8211; Onsite local information that just flat out makes sense and helps convert.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We determined that everything needing done on a website can be categorized into one of these 4 areas.
