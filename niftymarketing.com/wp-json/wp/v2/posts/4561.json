The idea was to repurpose the content into something bigger &amp; more comprehensive rather than keeping multiple pages focused on smaller topics. I wanted to see if it would help the main page perform better &amp; what impact (if any) it would have on each the terms the individual pages were targeting. We took the main body copy from about 420 words to 2023.<\/p>\n<p>We combined these 3 pages on 3-15-16 (focused on Motorcycle Accidents, Premises Liability &amp; Car Accidents):<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">http:\/\/www.clientdomain.com\/summerlin\/car-accident-lawyer<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">http:\/\/www.clientdomain.com\/summerlin\/premises-liability\/<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">http:\/\/www.clientdomain.com\/summerlin\/motorcycle-accident-lawyer<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Into this page (which was focused more broadly on Personal Injury):<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">http:\/\/www.clientdomain.com\/summerlin\/personal-injury-lawyer<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Test 1.2<\/h3>\n<p>Then we did another similar test where we combined three more geographically focused child pages into the main, parent page for the location (this time Henderson, NV). This took the page they were moved to from 413 words in body content to 1537 words. These pages (below) were combined on 6-29-16 and submitted the old 301ed urls as well as the url where they were moved to be indexed on 7-6-16 (mobile &amp; desktop) (focused on car, truck &amp; motorcycle accidents):<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">http:\/\/www.clientdomain.com\/henderson\/car-accident-lawyer<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">http:\/\/www.clientdomain.com\/henderson\/truck-accident-lawyer<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">http:\/\/www.clientdomain.com\/henderson\/motorcycle-accident-lawyer<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Into this page (again focused on personal injury):<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">http:\/\/www.clientdomain.com\/henderson\/personal-injury-lawyer<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Test 1.3<\/h3>\n<p>Finally, we combined 2 blog posts which were focused on motorcycle accidents in Las Vegas and rolled them up, adding them to the main landing pages focused on Las Vegas Motorcycle Accident Lawyer\/Attorney terms. We combined these two pages on 6-29-16 and on 7-6-16 and submitted desktop only to index.

Below is an example of what we wanted to see: From what we gathered from the example, there seemed to be some correlation to having a microsite with schema tied to the main business in these forming. In this particular example, the main site and microsite were both ranking prominently. Once schema was added it seemed to be the tipping point at which the one-pack started showing up in search results.<\/p>\n<p>For this test, our goal was to find a similar term\/s to one that was already producing a one-pack result in the SERPs. Then, try to set a foundation for it to happen with the similar term\/s where it wasn\u2019t yet showing a one-pack result. We found these terms which were already producing one-pack results: <i>\u201c<\/i><i>summerlin<\/i><i> personal injury <\/i><i>lawyer\u201d<\/i> &amp; <i>\u201c<\/i><i>summerlin<\/i><i> car accident lawyer\u201d<\/i>. Below are screenshots of the results: To implement this test, we chose these terms to create content around &amp; attempt to get a one-pack showing in search results: <i>\u201c<\/i><i>Summerlin<\/i> <i>motorcycle accident lawyer\u201d <\/i>and <i>\u201c<\/i><i>Summerlin<\/i> <i>bicycle accident lawyer<\/i><i>\u201d (+\u201dattorney\u201d variations)<\/i>. Since the clients main site was already ranking on the first page &amp; the competition was low to get the microsite there we started by creating content around the topics where needed.<\/p>\n<p>On 5\/24\/16, we added content to the microsite in the form of a page focused on each topic (Summerlin bicycle &amp; motorcycle accidents). We already had content on the clients main site for motorcycle accidents but on this same day added to that page Summerlin bicycle accident focused content. The following day (5-25-16) we also fetched (both mobile &amp; desktop) all the pages involved &amp; submitted to be indexed. By 6-6-16, both the microsite &amp; main site were showing prominently in search results for the related terms but not changes to display of search results as far as one-packs go. On this same day, we added additional schema to pages. Main site already contained attorney schema on the Summerlin page but microsite had no schema in place. We added local business to the Summerlin page on the main site (in addition to the attorney), local business schema to the microsite motorcycle page and attorney schema to the bicycle microsite page. On the following day (6-7-16) we again fetched &amp; submitted all three pages involved to be re-indexed.

The reason for using top ranking sites from the Avvo study was only to be sure we were looking at top performing sites in major metros, NOT to correlate these findings directly to their positions we looked at there. The goal was to identify if the top performing page and that pages top traffic yielding key term &amp; analyze if there were any defining elements that set it apart (2-10 times better) in comparison to the other top ranking results for that same term.<\/p>\n<p>As far as the data section of this study goes, defining 10x can be more difficult than it sounds. Party because what I think is 2-10 times better than something else is going to be somewhat different than what another person considers 2-10x. This is also very relative to the specific context of what we\u2019re looking at in relation to competing content for the same search term. There may be one aspect of the page that is 10 times better than the exact same aspect of another page (both of which are competing in search result) but that doesn\u2019t mean it necessarily means anything in relation to the term we\u2019re searching for. So, in short, I drew a few hard lines in the sand to help define what we\u2019re looking at &amp; consistently rate the results.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The sites looked at were 100 sites which placed #1 locally in our most recent Avvo study (at that time).<\/li>\n<li>The page analyzed for 10x content was not necessarily from the study (although it often overlapped) but rather what Ahrefs found to be the top traffic yielding page on the site.<\/li>\n<li>I only looked at the top traffic yielding key term (estimated by Ahrefs) for that highest traffic generating page.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0I then analyzed that page in relation to the top term to see if there were outstanding elements contained on it in in comparison to other top ranking page results for that same term. I only looked at organic competing pages. Whether the site scored was completely based in relation to competing results. The page could have been poor but 2-10 times better than competing pages which would have allowed the site to score. Likewise, it could have been outstanding but not more so than competing results which would not have allowed it to score between 2-10 times better.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0The score was loosely based on the 10 points Rand defined as what a 10x page may contain (<a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/how-to-create-10x-content-whiteboard-friday\">https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/how-to-create-10x-content-whiteboard-<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/how-to-create-10x-content-whiteboard-friday\">friday<\/a>) and scored one point for each of the following (but had to have at least 2 points to be considered as 2-10x):<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>\u2460 Great ui &amp; ux<\/strong> (This was based on our previous scoring system which utilized <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/insights\/\">Google Page Insights <\/a>&amp; needed to score 75+ as an average score across: <b>mobile speed, user <\/b><b>experience<\/b><b> &amp; desktop speed <\/b>to gain a point in this category. The page also had to be <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/webmasters\/tools\/mobile-friendly\/\">responsive<\/a><\/b> on top of the score reaching 75+ average to gain 1 point here.)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>\u2461 Quality<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>\u2462 Trust<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>\u2463 Useful<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>\u2464 Interesting<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>\u2465 Remarkable<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>\u2466 Different in scope<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>\u2467 Creates an emotional response<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>\u2468 Solved a problem<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>\u2469 Delivers in unique\/remarkable way<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One point was awarded for any page which seemed to deliver these elements better than the top competing organic results (minus local).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Data<\/h2>\n<p>Out of 100 top local ranking attorney\u2019s sites in major metros, this shows the percentage of sites which had anything approaching 10x content (in relation to their top performing page &amp; term) in comparison to those who did not:<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Type of 2-10x Content Found:<\/h3>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Head Term vs Long-Tail vs Branded<\/h4>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Is The 2-10x Content Intentional\/planned?<\/h3>\n<p>57% of pages with 10x elements, the highest performing page was clearly the most focused on the term &amp; likely best page to rank for the highest traffic yielding term (meaning the 10x elements were somewhat intentional).<\/p>\n<p>43% had 10x elements aligning with a the highest performing term in which that highest performing page was clearly not the most fitting page on the site to rank for the term (meaning, the 10x elements were likely not intended to rank the page for the term).<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Traffic to Top Performing Page Comparison<\/h3>\n<p>The traffic flow to the top performing page follows a similar pattern for 2-10x pages as with sites without: more pages have less traffic (1-100) with a slight uptick of pages with a high amount of traffic (900+). The average traffic for pages with 2-10x faired somewhat better at 366.8 compared to 323.9 for pages without.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Number Of Ranking Key Terms For Top Page Comparison<\/h3>\n<p>The number of ranking terms for the top performing page also follows a similar pattern for 2-10x pages as pages without: more pages have fewer ranking terms driving their traffic. However, there does seem to be slightly higher percentage of pages with 2-10x content that have a large number of ranking terms than pages without 2-10x content. The average number of ranking terms was higher for pages with 2-10 content at 199.1 compared to 143.3 for pages without.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Average Position For Top Traffic Producing Key Term<\/h3>\n<p>The average position in search results for the top traffic yielding term was substantially closer to #1 on average for pages with 2-10x content verses those without.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Average Traffic To Pages With 10x In Relation To 10x Score<\/h3>\n<p>Content that was 2x seemed to bring in the most value up until the content got to 7x or more.

However, due to the limited amount of pages in the study, takeaways from the data are limited.<\/p>\n<p>Average # Of Ranking Terms For Pages With 10x In Relation To 10x Score<\/p>\n<p>Overall, pages with 2-10x generate traffic from a more diverse source of keywords more often than those without. However, 2x content seemed to gain traffic from the highest amount of keywords on average.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Average # Of Ranking Terms In Relation To 10x Score, Separated By Type<\/h3>\n<p>Long-tail did best at 2x while head terms &amp; branded did better at 5, 7 or 9x.
