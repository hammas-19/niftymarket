Step one is to identify highly ranking competitors and look into what they are doing to rank well. The metrics provided in this section serve as a baseline and more in-depth research and analysis like page optimization tactics should be done. So, u<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">se the notes section provided to comment on different ranking elements like:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rich media<\/li>\n<li>Basic optimization<\/li>\n<li>Keyword usage<\/li>\n<li>Content length<\/li>\n<li>Quality of content<\/li>\n<li>Readability<\/li>\n<li>Thoroughness<\/li>\n<li>Keyword density<\/li>\n<li>Structured data<\/li>\n<li>Page load time<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Finally, jot down\u00a0anything else that your competitor is doing well <em>or different<\/em>. Are they nofollowing all outbound links on their service pages? Notice a FAQ section? Are they new to the scene on page 1 with only a fraction of the links of other competitors? Take note and dig deeper.<\/p>\n<h2>Uncovering Shared Links Among Competitors<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of BrightLocal&#8217;s features that I used to really like was their shared citations analysis. If you\u2019re not familiar, it tells you which local citations your\u00a0competitors have in common so you can target them yourself with confidence.\u00a0This spreadsheets works similarly, but you&#8217;ll have to do it manually &#8211; which is the whole point.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are a few reputable paid tools out there that build lists of shared links among competitors, they are all limited by sample size. None of them come even close to providing a complete overview. For best results, we recommend pulling linking domains from as many different tools as you can (Majestic, Ahrefs, WebMeUp, OSE, Cognitive, Raven, Spyglass, etc). With that said, let&#8217;s dive in.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using a backlink analysis tool(s) of your choice (SEOprofiler is a solid little freebie), export competitor linking domains for each competitor and copy\/paste them into the corresponding slots.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will most likely be duplicates within each column. You can quickly remove them using the &#8220;Remove Duplicates&#8221; Spreadsheet Add-on tool. Do yourself a favor and watch this <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/remove-duplicates\/bckmhokpcdnhhjldhhfpebhdfipmlbog?hl=en\">2 minute instructional<\/a>. Do this <\/span>individually<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for each column so that you\u2019re left with 5 unique competitor link columns. Side note: To clear empty cells, simply sort section A -Z.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, select the links from each column and paste them into the &#8220;Total Links&#8221; column until you\u2019ve done this for each competitor.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now we\u2019re ready to find shared competitor links. To do this, select all links within the Total Links column and use the &#8220;Remove Duplicates&#8221; Add-on tool to <strong>move duplicate values to a custom location<\/strong> (the first cell in the Shared Links column). <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When that&#8217;s done, you&#8217;re left with two things. <\/span>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Shared Links<\/strong>: a list of\u00a0promising leads that are shared between two or more of your competitors. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Total links<\/strong>:\u00a0a massive list of unique leads left over in the Total Links column.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Begin exploring shared leads looking for different angles to acquire a link, document your efforts and treat yourself with a Red Bull.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3972\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/competitor-shared-links.png\" alt=\"competitor-shared-links\" width=\"100%\" height=\"677\" srcset=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/competitor-shared-links.png 1122w, https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/competitor-shared-links-450x272.png 450w, https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/competitor-shared-links-300x181.png 300w, https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/competitor-shared-links-768x463.png 768w, https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/competitor-shared-links-1024x618.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1122px) 100vw, 1122px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you&#8217;ve exhausted your list of shared leads, you can revisit the Total Links column where you\u2019ll definitely uncover more opportunities as you prospect there.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What\u00a0You Can Achieve<\/h2>\n<p>After using this sheet for a few weeks, here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve gathered.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>2 hours<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span>\u00a0t<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ime to complete 6-step process<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>30 shared link prospects<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: number of shared linking opportunities uncovered <\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>10 good leads: <\/b>n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">umber of viable leads out of the shared prospects<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>4 links<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: number of links acquired <\/span><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>*<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">based on averages from a single query and the use of only one backlink explorer tool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might expect to uncover about 30 <\/span>shared<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> link building opportunities in a couple of hours.
