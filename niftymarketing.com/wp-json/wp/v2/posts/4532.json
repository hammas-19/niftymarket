The more links you had the higher and faster your site shot up the rankings.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Change of tactic<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The tactic of including many links on each page is not a useful tactic anymore and is even frowned upon. Utilizing this same tactic today can have the opposite effect on your site and can see you plunging down to the 10th\u00a0o of Google in no time.\u00a0 What matters today is <strong>QUALITY<\/strong> over <em>quantity<\/em>, Google has put a major emphasis on sites getting links from pages that are not only relevant to your site but are also trusted sources.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Quality is important now<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Quality over quantity gives the searcher (the most important person in Google\u2019s eyes) the best results and improves their user experience. It provides them the most relevant results for the searches that they perform. Search engines that don\u2019t have quality links incorporated in their results algorithm end up not providing users with usable, pertinent results.\u00a0 You don\u2019t have to believe me, but my friend Matt Cutts will back me up&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Is there a version of Google that excludes backlinks as a ranking factor?\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" data-url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/NCY30WhI2og?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3><strong>How Do You Link Build?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Link building may sound new and techy, but don\u2019t be scared off by it. The backbone of link building is nothing new. Link Building is a term created by the web generation for a new industry, but many of the tactics and strategies used by web marketers are similar to those used in the pre-computer era. Link building has many things in common with Public Relations; think of it as Digital PR.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, here are the 3 R\u2019s that I always keep in mind when I am reaching out to people to start the link building process.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Be Real<\/h4>\n<p>Don\u2019t expect to build high quality links by sending out large template based e-mail blasts. Behind each site is a person, a person that you need to create a relationship with.\u00a0 Whenever possible your outreach emails should include their name, something they may be interested in, or something they have written about.\u00a0 Start a conversation, don\u2019t just spam them with what you want. Be real and build relationships! Follow them on Twitter, Facebook, or other social media sites that you can use to build a relationship.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Be a <strong>R<\/strong>esource<\/h4>\n<p>Much like being real, you need to be a resource, be someone that adds value. This means, follow the sites you want to be linked to.\u00a0 Get to know what they write about, post about or are interested in.\u00a0 How can you and your site be an added value to their site? Do you have videos, infographics, or are you an expert in their field of interest?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Be <strong>R<\/strong>elevant<\/h4>\n<p>Lastly and most important be relevant. Have something in common with the site you are reaching out to. Look to see if you have a post on your site that would enhance something on theirs? Is there something happening in the news that is relevant between your two fields? \u00a0One of the worst things you can do is reach out to sites that you have nothing in common with. Do not reach out to sites that have nothing in common with yours, you will come off as spammy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As mentioned above, link building is highly important, not only does it account for where your website appears on the SERP, but also how often your site is being seen around the Internet world. Every link may not be a follow link, but getting your brand out there should always be on the back of your mind. \u00a0You want your site to get as much exposure as possible, if your site is not seen, you simply do not get visitors. If you don\u2019t get visitors, you don\u2019t generate business\u2026 at least from your website.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Number Crunching<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Recently, here at Nifty, we did a study on the effects of link building, it being one of the major pillars of local search. We compared five different practice areas in 100 different cities that were ranking 1-3 in the local pack compared to those ranking 8-10. We also did this same comparison for the organic rankings.<\/p>\n<p>First, lets take a look at what the study said on the local level. After crunching hundreds of numbers, rankings of 1-3 average 5,367 backlinks, while rankings of 8-10 average about 5,739. The numbers were pretty close so we had to roll up our sleeves and dig deeper. From these numbers the conclusion can be made that, although links do play a huge part, for local search it\u2019s just as important to have other aspects done like citations and reviews. You can have thousands of more links than your competitor and not rank well locally if these things are overlooked.<\/p>\n<p>Organic search results are on a different level. The average links for organic search 1-3 is 23,233 while position 8-10 is only 12,239 backlinks. It is obvious to see that if your goal is to rank organically, links play a huge role. The top ranking websites had on average more than double than the 8-10 spot.\u00a0 Links are highly important as a Google ranking factor, especially if you want to rank organically.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Give Me Links!<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><em>\u201cThere was a brief time in SEO history where you could build thousands of spam links and watch your site climb to the top of the first page. Those days are long gone.\u00a0SEOs that do well today dedicate serious resources (time, money, and skilled labor) towards their link building campaigns.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -Brian Deal, author of Backlinko<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I know what you\u2019re thinking, \u201cyeah, I know links are important but how do I get them? I have money, lets buy some.\u201d First off, stop buying them, Google will hate you forever and you will drop in the SERP faster than the speed of light. Second, let me share some ideas we have done here at Nifty.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Internal Link Building<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/xml-spider-crawling.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-719\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/xml-spider-crawling.gif\" alt=\"xml-spider-crawling\" width=\"429\" height=\"306\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Internal links are links that go from one page on a\u00a0domain\u00a0to a different page on the same domain. They are most commonly used in the main navigation but should be used more regularly. There are three main reasons for internal link building,<\/p>\n<p>1) It makes it easier for the user to navigate through your site;<\/p>\n<p>2) It establishes information hierarchy.<\/p>\n<p>3) It helps spread link juice throughout the site.<\/p>\n<p>Many sites have a blog; do you put links back to other pages on your site with more information in your blog posts? Do it!\u00a0 How many internal links do you have on each page? We suggest trying to get one to two internal links per page.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Citations \/ Directories<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Citations are your NAP listing on places like Google, Yelp, and Yahoo etc. Directories are a more in depth mention of a specific lawyer, not just the business\u2019 location.\u00a0 Although the amount of citations you have are important, it\u2019s not as important as consistency. If on one of your citations it says you are located in Las Vegas and the next one claims you are in Los Angeles; major red flag folks. Citations may seem like an easy way to get links to your site, but they are very finicky. They should be regularly checked on and monitored. One month they could look great, then the next month things have gone missing, or your phone number was changed. So keep a close eye on these listings, but remember they are very important and should be done.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Link Reclamation<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This is one of the easier types of link building, that is, if you\u2019ve been involved in the community. People talk; it\u2019s a fact of life. Many times when you get involved in the community, people talk about you. \u00a0You can do a Google search for your name or business or you can find instances using <a href=\"https:\/\/freshwebexplorer.moz.com\/\">Moz\u2019s Fresh Mention tool<\/a>. With this tool, you can see if local media outlets like bloggers, news sites, or local businesses have mentioned you. If you or your business has been mentioned, reach out and ask for a link to your site. If you are a fairly well known attorney, there should be new opportunities on a monthly and sometimes weekly basis. \u00a0Just as Jason Acidre stated, \u201cAlways seek for link opportunities and suitable linking targets; because once you\u2019ve reached the top, your competitors will never stop trying to outrank you \u2013 make this part of your campaign\u2019s daily tasks.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Contests &amp; Giveaways<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This is where creativity is key. I just mentioned how being known in the community can get you easy links. Find a way to give back to the community. Make yourself known and as an added bonus, receive some link juice back to your website. A great example of this could be a scholarship. You could do a one-time scholarship or a yearly scholarship. You get to make the guideline, credentials etc. then you simply reach out to your local schools, or even statewide schools telling them this scholarship is available and asking for a link back. Google loves .edu sites, so if they are linking to you, that\u2019s like gold.<\/p>\n<p>Another great idea is to hold a contest. The sky is the limit with this, if you want to sponsor a hot dog eating contest, great! Let the community know and get links from places like the radio station, community calendars, or local bloggers. How about a race, best Instagram picture or a video\/commercial contest that covers something to do with your type of law business.\u00a0 There are all kinds of great ideas, some just take a little time and attention but can increase your link building campaign, which in return, increase&#8217;s your rankings and business.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/SURqTJe.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-722\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/SURqTJe-282x300.jpg\" alt=\"SURqTJe\" width=\"282\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Rand Fishkin from Moz said it best when he said,<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSEO stuff is okay.

No one is better prepared to handle change than we are.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Buying links is so 2013, move on, step up and get moving on your link building campaign.
