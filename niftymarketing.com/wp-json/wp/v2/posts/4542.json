I\u2019m not talking about the occasional paid link- I\u2019m talking about a backlink portfolio that comes home the next morning with someone else\u2019s lipstick on its collar; the cheating is that obvious.<\/p>\n<p>I hate to oversimplify it, but here\u2019s how the Internet works: Search engines like Google use complex algorithms to decide who will rank and, by extension, who will not. While Google claims to have over 200 different ranking factors in their algorithm, one factor we know all search engines use is hyperlinks. Links between web sites always have been, and always will be, an essential part of these algorithms. Once upon a time Google couldn\u2019t really tell natural links from unnatural links, but those days are long gone. Google\u2019s \u201cPenguin\u201d algorithm update evaluates sites with low quality or spammy links, and de-indexes or un-ranks the living heck out of them. There MAY be like one or two (hundred) other things I left out, but that\u2019s basically how it works.<\/p>\n<p>While pitching in on NiftyLaw\u2019s recent study into top ranking attorneys, I spotted a couple of these bad boys; I couldn\u2019t help but dig a little deeper into why they\u2019re so bad and how they\u2019re pulling it off. I want to discuss a few of my findings here. It is important to remember these guys are the exception, not the rule. Thanks to algorithmic updates, remaining on that first page without following Google\u2019s rules is becoming increasingly rare. However, just like real-life delinquents, these attorneys can either grow up and \u2018disavow\u2019 their bad habits, or suffer the penalties; the future well-being of their site depends on that choice.<\/p>\n<h3>The Unrepentant Sinner<\/h3>\n<p>During our study I found a certain Florida attorney ranking #1 both in the organic and local pack for his search term. This guy was exactly where he wanted to be. Was it his sterling link building practices? <b>Unequivocally no.<\/b> The site had 6,087 links from just 87 domains. I think the genie from Aladdin described this situation best. Over 6,000 links represents the possibility of phenomenal cosmic power. Pair that with just 87 domains, and you\u2019re cramming that power into an itty-bitty living space.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/aladdin.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-918\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/aladdin-264x300.png\" alt=\"Itty Bitty Living Space\" width=\"308\" height=\"350\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve always heard links described as \u2018votes\u2019 between sites, like an election. So, if one candidate gets 6,000 votes from 6,000 voters, and another candidate gets 6,000 votes from just 87 voters, whom will the police arrest for voter fraud? And if we can make that deduction about this site\u2019s links with a single glance, Google\u2019s Penguin algorithm will tear this site apart\u2026 eventually.\u00a0He\u2019s still ranking #1 organically, over 3 months after the study has concluded. He\u2019s nowhere to be found in the local pack though, which could be a sign that the authorities are on to him.<\/p>\n<h3>The Redemption Seeker<\/h3>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at another delinkuent, this time in Washington. At the time of our study, this attorney had a staggering 120,500 links coming from just under 200 domains. Again, it\u2019s possible that some of these links are legitimate, right? According to my Cognitive SEO report on link quality, there\u2019s a tiny, TINY slice on a pie chart that demonstrated their good link authority. The other 99.2% looked terrible.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/2siteauthority.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-919 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/2siteauthority-260x300.png\" alt=\"Terrible Link Authority\" width=\"260\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Have his spammy links affected his ranking? I checked back in on this top ranking hoodlum recently, and found that he had dropped in organic rankings &#8211; from #1 to #5. Big deal, he\u2019s still on the first page. However, there\u2019s a very good reason why he only lost 4 positions. Where before I had found over 120,000 links, now I\u2019m only showing about a thousand. Based on his updated link profile, we can make another deduction. Just after our study concluded, this attorney had disavowed all but .8% of his total links. Now take a look at his link profile authority.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/site2new.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-920 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/site2new-278x300.png\" alt=\"Better Link Authority\" width=\"278\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you think sorting through your links, identifying the bad guys, and generating and uploading a disavow file sounds like a lot of work, you\u2019re right. It can be tedious, and if you\u2019re ranking well in spite of some shady linking history, it can be hard to motivate yourself to make that change. This next sentence is so important I\u2019m going to make it bright orange. <span style=\"color: #ff6600\"><b>It\u2019s much easier to prevent a penalty than it is to recover from one<\/b>.<\/span> Now, our Washington attorney has a healthy mix of authoritative links and the added benefit of maintaining his first-page position throughout the process. This delinkuent was proactive; he turned his situation around. If sites like this shape up before penalties fall, they stand a chance of not only surviving, but maintaining long term rankings.<\/p>\n<h3>Can You Hear That Sobbing?<\/h3>\n<p>So, we have an unrepentant, un-penalized delinkuent, and a repentant, un-penalized former delinkuent. I know what you\u2019re thinking- \u201cwhere are the penalties? I want to see some punishment!\u201d As long as it\u2019s not your site, right? Don\u2019t worry, our study is replete with examples of Google dishing out punishment, but their stories are pretty short.<\/p>\n<p>For example, here\u2019s the sob story of a mid-west personal injury attorney I checked back in on. At the time of our study, he held a first-page rank. Now, Moz\u2019s \u2018Rank Tracker\u2019 tells me he\u2019s \u201cNot in top 50.\u201d I didn\u2019t bother looking farther down the list for him, and neither will his potential clients. That\u2019s why getting penalized means you can kiss your site traffic goodbye.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/panguin3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-921 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/niftymarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/panguin3-300x260.png\" alt=\"Penguin Effects\" width=\"300\" height=\"260\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>As for the delinkuents still slipping through the cracks, there\u2019s more bad news coming their way. That last guy most likely suffered a manual penalty rather than a true penguin penalty. That\u2019s because Penguin hasn\u2019t been officially updated since October 2013. The next Penguin update has been a long time coming, and it\u2019s due to be released any time. As you can see from my screenshot, getting hit by penguin will wreck your traffic flow just as much as a manual penalty.<\/p>\n<h3>The Golden Rule of Penalties<\/h3>\n<p>If I had to come up with one thought you should take away from this post it would be the following: <b>Learn from someone else\u2019s mistakes<\/b>. If you have any doubt about your link practices in the past (whether you did them or hired a company) you need to review your link profile and prepare a disavow file before you get hit with a penalty. Here\u2019s a link to help you get started: <a href=\"http:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/link-audit-guide-for-effective-link-removals-risk-mitigation\">http:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/link-audit-guide-for-effective-link-removals-risk-mitigation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you happen to be counting on plausible deniability, I have some sad news for you. Google doesn\u2019t care where the links came from. The tactic of \u201cMy old SEO Company did those, I had no idea what they were doing\u201d won\u2019t hold up in a reinclusion request and even less if you get hit by penguin. Your only tactic is to try and clean up your profile now before you get hit. As the great American Benjamin Franklin once (almost) said, \u201cAn ounce of Penguin prevention is worth a pound of penalty recovery.\u201d Words to live by.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; What is a delinkuent?
