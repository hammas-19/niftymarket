This group is smart enough not to try have have 5 or 6 links at the top. Heck, they are barely in the 10 pack in some places. But, they have done this in every major market across the country. They are probably bringing in ton and tons of phone calls every day and finding low prices for people&#8230;But, is it right? Is it fair to real &#8220;brick and mortar&#8221; companies who are actually pest control service companies? I am going to have to say no.<br \/>\n<br class=\"blank\" \/><br \/>\nNow, I have submitted this to Google Map Spam and will be very interested to see if this issue gets resolved in the coming days. If it doesn&#8217;t&#8230;it is a major problem, and would fall under Mike Blumenthals <a href=\"http:\/\/blumenthals.com\/blog\/2009\/08\/20\/google-maps-customer-service-hall-of-shame-what-goes-on-in-your-neighborhood\/\" target=\"_blank\">Hall of Shame Post<\/a>. (which I highly recommend)<\/p>\n<h2>One More Gripe For The Road<\/h2>\n<p>While dealing with the same pest control listing I have been working on, I moved to the 3rd spot in a very competitive market and somebody went in and changed the listing address and company name. While I tried to resolve this through the simple community edit..It hasn&#8217;t fixed anything.<br \/>\n<br class=\"blank\" \/><br \/>\nEven though we claimed the listing and had it verified it was hijacked and now my &#8220;verified&#8221; listing information is not correlating with the one appearing and I can&#8217;t seem to merge the two files.
