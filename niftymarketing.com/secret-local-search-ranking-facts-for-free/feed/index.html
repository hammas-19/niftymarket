					<description><![CDATA[Mike - the word secret got me here.  Nice work on the details.  It seems optimizing for local search is similar to SEO in general, but just another layer that needs to be done and worked on over time just to get and keep a site in the coveted top 5.

Thanks for the &quot;Secrets&quot;

I think Dan Brown brought the world &quot;secret&quot; into the main stream, and those those credit report people definitely coined &quot;free&quot;. Liars if you ask me. 

Thanks for stopping by Alex]]></description>
