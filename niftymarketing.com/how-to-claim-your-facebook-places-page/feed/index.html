					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the explanation.  Do you think in the future Facebook will allow a business to be claimed without having to check-in via a smart phone?  That would make it more user-friendly, and increase the amount of business listings claimed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://niftymarketing.com/how-to-claim-your-facebook-places-page/#comment-200&quot;&gt;Marjory Meechan&lt;/a&gt;.

Yup you have to create it with an iphone first. Then claim. And I saw a screen shot of a phone verification bit they siding have that option when I verified. I had to submit a legal doc. So I took a picture of mine and sent it in. I do t know if that will stay. My guess is a phone verification. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, if I&#039;m understanding this right, first you have to Check in with the business with a cell phone which creates a listing in Facebook and then once it&#039;s there you can claim it?

And seriously, can you verify with a phone or do you have to file papers? (I know, you&#039;re convinced by now that I&#039;m a complete idiot but you lost at that part)

I don&#039;t have a smart phone - I&#039;ve been resisting in the hopes I would reduce my internet hours which already are a little frightening but I&#039;m sensing that resistance may be futile.]]></description>
