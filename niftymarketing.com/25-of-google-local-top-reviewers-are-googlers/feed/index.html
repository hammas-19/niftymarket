I thought about that, Thomas. It would be interesting to unravel Yelp and see if the same bias exists perceived or otherwise. However, I think the irony is the hypocritical nature of Google not following its own policies regarding reviews. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blumenthals.com/blog/2013/01/14/google-review-contests-violate-guidelines/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Check out Blumenthals post on that&lt;/a&gt;.  ]]></description>

Interesting...truth is G+ is growing in active users, there&#039;s no question. I am speculating as to whether this eventually becomes a huge game, obviously if what you&#039;re saying is true, that sure matches what I found. Especially in San Fran - go Niners.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are we surprised?... And I am sure they are not getting paid (ON THE CLOCK) to write these reviews... Of course not, they are salaried.

... but hey, there are a lot of Elite Yelpers that work for Yelp, so what&#039;s the big deal? Everyone is doing it.

Back when insiderpages.com opened their doors I got a $50 gift certificate from them for completing 50 reviews by a deadline.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post. And I&#039;ll let you in on a secret. The employees compete for rewards based on the number of posts they do (and the number of friends they recruit to do posts). 

I know because my friend is a Googler who tried to recruit me. Anyway, she won one of the prizes, which was a private meal for 10 at one of the most expensive SF restaurants. This was a while ago, but I imagine they are still doing this kind of astro-turfing.  

G+ is tragically unhip, and it&#039;s kind of pathetic what Google will do to make appear successful (like announcing 27 Billion active users per second).]]></description>

Interesting, Nick. Although the data set is small - I think it&#039;s obvious what&#039;s going on. On the tool I mentioned (it doesn&#039;t index everyone in + but enough) it shows Bangalore with 102k subscribers - I wonder if numbers translate over there as well.]]></description>

Greg, absolutely. They aren&#039;t coy about it either - they have internal pushes to get reviews I was made aware of after the fact. But check out #reviewsday (hat tip to Mike Wilton @mwilton13) - ya all the offices I checked out participate there. Maybe a good follow up post? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting study.

Have just had a quick look here in London and for the first 50 businesses that show up the top reviewer is a Google employee (all from their community management team) for 23 of them, so 46%. Another of the top reviewers is the social media manager from Wowcher, a daily deals site here in the UK.

Not entirely sure what that tells us though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hah! Long gone are the Do No Evil days. Maybe they&#039;ll penalize themselves for an epic amount of time (not to exceed thirty days) and use it as yet another teaching moment for the rest of us, from &quot;Don&#039;t Do as I do U.&quot; 

Sadly, the default &quot;rogue contractor that will be severely dealt with&quot; defense will be a wee bit harder to pull off here. Talk about an unnatural review profile.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the mention, Linda. It&#039;s a phenomenon that everyone has to play by Google&#039;s rules, except Google. It will be interesting to see how this unfolds and where the platform heads with the efforts we&#039;re noticing.]]></description>
