					<description><![CDATA[Hey Mike,

Sorry I missed the webinar but from your review it sounds similar to what Gib typically talks about.

Gib&#039;s a friend of mine so I&#039;ve heard it a few times.

We&#039;ve found UBL to be hit or miss. In one case we felt like it pulled a listing into the map on the first shot but in others we&#039;ve seen no impact or increase in &quot;web pages&quot; count.

We&#039;re getting ready to trial Localeze for the same concept.

In regard to 800 #s, if you&#039;ve got one you should definitely list it. As Gib said though it&#039;s agreement among NAP which make the correlation for the engines so your local number is likely most important for local search directories.

Localeze powers a lot of online yellow pages - just cruise down to the bottom of http://www.yellowbot.com/gogreen-organic-beauty-spa-new-york-ny.html
