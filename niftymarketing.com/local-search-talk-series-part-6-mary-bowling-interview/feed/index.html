					<description><![CDATA[Mary, your mountain town sounds beautiful and you are one vigorous outdoors-person! Fun to read a bit more about your hobbies and background. I also found it interesting to learn that solving local problems is your favorite thing about Local. I have to say, I like it a lot better when there are no problems to solve and everything goes swimmingly, but certainly, problems are a challenge to learn more!

Another nice interview, Mike, and a pleasure to read about Mary who I shall always remember as the first woman (besides myself) I ever heard of who was into all this Local stuff. Up until then, I thought I just might be the odd woman out :)]]></description>
