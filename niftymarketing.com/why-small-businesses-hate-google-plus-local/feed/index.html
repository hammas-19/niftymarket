					<description><![CDATA[I also followed this over from the 40 local search questions article. This is too funny, well too funny and too sad and too real all at the same time. 

With a number of people I&#039;ve spoken with, it isn&#039;t only the (too) many steps involved in actually writing the review but the requirement of your full name to be posted. I know Google thinks it will keep down fake reviews but at the same time it is keeping down legit reviews. 

Even in a negative sense, if I have a bad experience at a local restaurant, do I want to be named as the person who left the bad review forever? Even with positive reviews, I don&#039;t want someone googling my name and saying, &quot;oh look, here is where he likes his frozen yogurt, here is where he bathes his dog, he doesn&#039;t like that one car place and there is right where he lives!&quot; ... no thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[HI Mike...

Your &quot;comigraphic&quot; is simply priceless. I just read your article over on Seomoz.org (40 Important Local Search Questions Answered) where you provided a link to it here.

Boy am I glad I clicked that link to take a look.

You really have nailed the current situation. Even though this post was published many months ago... the frustration continues.

Thanks again. I needed a bit of humor on this subject.

					<description><![CDATA[If it wasn&#039;t for some of the exaggerations and illustrations this could serve as the actual process!!  I see that Google have released new guidelines today and have warned against 3rd party reviews.  It is with little wonder that this practice has been carried out with a throw more sh*t and some of it will stick.  I hope the new system will prove fairer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Brilliant and sad simultaneously.  Google&#039;s arrogance has no bounds and that is demonstrated so well with their Google+ Local (formerly Places, Maps, Buzz, Boost).

					<description><![CDATA[Great infographic! This is too funny and sadly, very true. This is exactly what we&#039;re trying to solve at the company I&#039;m working for. 

I work for a company called Terillion (terillion.com/reviews) and we help local businesses get real reviews from their real customers at the point of service. Customers simply write a quick review on our new iPad kiosk app. The customers themselves then distribute those reviews and interactions to places like Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yelp, Trip Adviser, our own Terillion directory and more. With this service, fake reviews aren&#039;t needed and real reviews are easy to collect and distribute. 

Just thought I&#039;d share so you could know there a things being done to stop this plague of ridiculous/hard to get/fake reviews. :) Again, thanks for the great infographic. It&#039;s very much appreciated. We had some good laughs here at the office.
