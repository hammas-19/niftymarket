					<description><![CDATA[Nice write-up Mike, thanks for sharing this. 

I wasn&#039;t able to go this year, but this conference is one of my favorites and I try to go every year.

The sessions at PubCon tend to be more informative than most, and the people you meet are awesome. 

Maybe we can hang out in the stretch limo next year!]]></description>
