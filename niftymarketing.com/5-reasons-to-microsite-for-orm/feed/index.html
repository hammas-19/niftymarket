					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://niftymarketing.com/5-reasons-to-microsite-for-orm/#comment-274&quot;&gt;Rakesh Ramani&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for the response Rakesh,
I would start with one site and possibly expand on that if the need arises. I would link back in a few places where it makes sense without overdoing it, possibly with an offer or discount and additional information on services. The initial set up will likely be the most work for the site. From there, you may have a few things to consider, such as updating reviews or deals. The complexity &#038; upkeep is largely determined by how much you want to put into it but I would keep the focus fairly narrow, primarily answering potential concerns.

Crucial points: keep it simple, answer concerns, show positive feedback.

Hope this helps,

Ryan]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Ryan,

You are absolutely correct to create micro sites but how many micro site and what other crucial points we should keep in mind while creating it. how many links we should get from this microsite for our main domain? etc...

What about the maintaining those sites? dont you think it will be very time consuming task? 

Thanks
Rakesh]]></description>
